# üîç **Why Knowledge Graph Gets Lower Scores - Technical Analysis**

## üéØ **Root Cause Analysis**

You're seeing a consistent pattern where **Knowledge Graph scores lower** than Graph RAG and standard RAG. This is happening for several **technical and architectural reasons** that are actually **expected behavior** rather than bugs.

---

## üìä **Score Calculation Logic**

Looking at the dashboard code, the **confidence_score** is calculated as:

```python
# For RAG and Graph RAG:
avg_score = sum(retrieved_context.vector_scores) / len(retrieved_context.vector_scores)

# For Knowledge Graph Only:
avg_score = 0.0  # Because retrieved_context.vector_scores is EMPTY!
```

### **üî¥ Critical Issue: Knowledge Graph Has NO Vector Scores**

**Knowledge Graph retriever returns:**
- ‚úÖ `text_chunks = []` (empty - no text content)
- ‚úÖ `vector_scores = []` (empty - no similarity scores)  
- ‚úÖ `graph_data = GraphData` (nodes and relationships)

**This means:**
- **Confidence Score** = 0.0 (no vector scores to average)
- **Source Diversity** = 0.0 (no text chunks with sources)
- **Retrieved Chunks** = 0 (no text content)

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Design Differences**

### **1. Standard RAG**
```python
# Gets text chunks + vector similarity scores
text_chunks: [chunk1, chunk2, chunk3]  # Has content
vector_scores: [0.85, 0.78, 0.72]      # Has similarity scores
confidence_score: 0.78                  # Average of scores
```

### **2. Graph RAG (Hybrid)**
```python
# Gets BOTH text chunks + graph relationships
text_chunks: [chunk1, chunk2, chunk3]  # Has content  
vector_scores: [0.85, 0.78, 0.72]      # Has similarity scores
graph_data: {nodes, edges}             # PLUS graph context
confidence_score: 0.78                  # Same vector average + graph boost
```

### **3. Knowledge Graph Only**
```python
# Gets ONLY graph relationships, NO text content
text_chunks: []                         # EMPTY - no text
vector_scores: []                       # EMPTY - no scores  
graph_data: {nodes, edges}             # Only graph context
confidence_score: 0.0                   # No scores to average!
```

---

## üö® **Why This Happens**

### **1. Pure Graph Approach vs Hybrid**
- **Knowledge Graph Only** = Pure symbolic/structured retrieval
- **Graph RAG** = Vector retrieval ENHANCED with graph context
- **Standard RAG** = Pure vector similarity

### **2. Different Information Types**
- **Vector Scores** = Semantic similarity (0.0-1.0)
- **Graph Relationships** = Symbolic connections (binary)
- **Text Content** = Natural language chunks

### **3. Scoring System Bias**
The current scoring system is **biased toward vector-based methods** because:
- Confidence = average of vector similarity scores
- Knowledge Graph has no vector scores by design

---

## üîß **How to Fix the Scoring**

### **Option 1: Modify Knowledge Graph Confidence Calculation**

```python
# In comparison_dashboard.py, around line 440-460
if system_name == "Knowledge Graph":
    # Special scoring for pure graph retrieval
    if retrieved_context.graph_data and retrieved_context.graph_data.nodes:
        # Score based on graph connectivity and relevance
        graph_score = min(len(retrieved_context.graph_data.nodes) / 10.0, 1.0)
        avg_score = graph_score * 0.8  # Scale to reasonable range
    else:
        avg_score = 0.1  # Minimum score if no graph data
else:
    # Original vector-based scoring for RAG and Graph RAG
    avg_score = (
        sum(retrieved_context.vector_scores) / len(retrieved_context.vector_scores)
        if retrieved_context.vector_scores else 0.0
    )
```

### **Option 2: Graph-Aware Metrics**

Add new metrics specifically for Knowledge Graph:

```python
def calculate_graph_metrics(graph_data):
    if not graph_data or not graph_data.nodes:
        return {"connectivity": 0.0, "relevance": 0.0, "coverage": 0.0}
    
    return {
        "connectivity": len(graph_data.edges) / max(len(graph_data.nodes), 1),
        "relevance": min(len(graph_data.nodes) / 8.0, 1.0),  # Assume 8 is good coverage
        "coverage": len(set(node.entity_type for node in graph_data.nodes)) / 5.0  # Entity diversity
    }
```

---

## üéØ **Expected Performance Patterns**

### **When Knowledge Graph SHOULD Score Higher:**
1. **Relationship Questions**: "How does X connect to Y?"
2. **Multi-hop Reasoning**: "What's the relationship between A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C?"
3. **Structured Queries**: "Show me all technologies related to blockchain"
4. **Explainable Results**: When you need to show WHY something is connected

### **When Graph RAG SHOULD Score Higher:**
1. **Complex Mixed Queries**: Semantic similarity + relationships
2. **Best of Both Worlds**: Vector relevance + graph context
3. **Nuanced Questions**: Natural language with implicit relationships

### **When Standard RAG SHOULD Score Higher:**
1. **Simple Factual Questions**: "What is blockchain?"
2. **Speed Requirements**: Fastest retrieval method
3. **Large-scale Content**: When you have massive text corpora

## üîç **Diagnostic Commands**

### **Check What Knowledge Graph Actually Returns:**
```python
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('src')
from src.rag_system.retrieval.retrievers import KnowledgeGraphRetriever
# Test what KG retriever actually returns
"
```

### **Compare Retrieved Content:**
```python
# Add debug logging to see what each method retrieves:
print(f'RAG chunks: {len(retrieved_context.text_chunks)}')
print(f'Vector scores: {retrieved_context.vector_scores}')
print(f'Graph nodes: {len(retrieved_context.graph_data.nodes) if retrieved_context.graph_data else 0}')
```

---

## üí° **Quick Fix Recommendation**

**Add this to comparison_dashboard.py around line 440:**

```python
# Calculate metrics from RetrievalContext
num_chunks = len(retrieved_context.text_chunks)

# Special handling for Knowledge Graph scoring
if system_name == "Knowledge Graph":
    # Score based on graph quality instead of vector similarity
    if retrieved_context.graph_data and retrieved_context.graph_data.nodes:
        # Graph-based confidence: connectivity + coverage
        num_nodes = len(retrieved_context.graph_data.nodes)
        num_edges = len(retrieved_context.graph_data.edges) if retrieved_context.graph_data.edges else 0
        connectivity = num_edges / max(num_nodes, 1)
        coverage = min(num_nodes / 8.0, 1.0)  # Normalize to reasonable range
        avg_score = (connectivity + coverage) / 2.0
        avg_score = max(0.4, min(avg_score, 0.9))  # Keep in reasonable range
    else:
        avg_score = 0.2  # Low but not zero if no graph data found
else:
    # Original vector-based scoring for RAG and Graph RAG
    avg_score = (
        sum(retrieved_context.vector_scores) / len(retrieved_context.vector_scores) 
        if retrieved_context.vector_scores else 0.0
    )
```

This will give Knowledge Graph **fair scoring based on graph connectivity** rather than penalizing it for not having vector similarity scores.

---

## üéØ **Bottom Line**

**Knowledge Graph gets lower scores because:**
1. **It doesn't return text chunks or vector scores by design**
2. **Current scoring system only measures vector similarity**
3. **It's optimized for different types of queries (relationships vs. content)**

**The solution is to implement graph-aware scoring** that measures what Knowledge Graph is actually good at: **connectivity, relationship mapping, and structured knowledge traversal**.
