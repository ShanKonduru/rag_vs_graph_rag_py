Week 3: CTO as Innovation Catalyst: Discovering Innovation 
Opportunities 

Video 1: Module Overview  

When we talked about the role and value of a Chief Technology Officer, we said that 
one of the key elements of the role is that as a strategy catalyst. Another important role 
that a Chief Technology Officer plays is that as an innovation catalyst. So here, we will 
dig deeper into what does that role mean?  

What  are  the  types  of  ideas,  concepts  and  frameworks will  help  a  Chief  Technology 
Officer  be  an  effective  innovation  catalyst?  We  will  focus  upon  how  does  a  Chief 
Technology  Officer  be  an  effective  catalyst  in  discovering  opportunities  for  digital 
innovation. We will talk about a concept called digital innovation sweet spots. What are 
they and how can you identify those spots? First, we'll learn about a tool called business 
model and how can we develop a business model? Second, using the business model 
as a lens, can we identify a portfolio of opportunities, which we call digital innovation 
sweet spots? So, those are the topics that we will focus upon in this module.  

Video 2: Business Models 

A business model is a useful and fundamentally important tool, through which we can 
understand  a  firm's  strategy.  We  can  understand  how  does  it  generate  value  in  a 
sustainable manner and use that as a foundation for identifying opportunities for digital 
innovation. This is a tool that provides a holistic approach towards describing a firm's 
business strategy in an actionable manner. As you will see on the graphic, there are 
four important components of a business model. They are: what is the customer value 
proposition?  

What are the critical resources that the firm applies in support of its value proposition? 
What are the critical processes and capabilities and what is the profit model? Let's try 
to  understand  each  one  of  them  turn  by  turn.  We  already  talked  earlier  about  the 
customer  value  proposition,  which  is  really  fundamentally  asking  three  important 
questions. First, who is the customer? Sometimes, firms make the mistake of not being 
laser-focused on who is their customer and who is not their customer, and we'll show 
that with a couple of examples. So, who is your customer? Secondly, how do you build 
that relationship with the customer? What is it that you deliver in a superior manner that 
helps build that relationship? Is it because your ability to do product innovation? Is it 
because you are the lowest cost provider, and you provide sustainable low cost value? 
Or is it because you really are knowledgeable about the customer? You have imagined 
your business about the customer, and you can identify their different needs through 
cross-selling and upselling, very different ways of serving the customer. And the third 
aspect is, which of these are important ways of delivering value to the customer. So, 
the value proposition is based upon the realisation that strategy really has to be built 

 ISB CTO

around  the  customer needs. We talked  earlier about  delivered  and  latent needs,  the 
customer needs and how do you do that in a superior manner.  

Now, once you have identified the value proposition, the next two questions are: how 
are  you  going  to  deliver  them  in  a  superior  and  a  sustainable  manner?  You  do  that 
through  resources  and  processes  and  capabilities.  What  are  resources?  Critical 
resources are the assets that the firm will invest in. This could be human talent, this 
could be brand, this could be people, this could be store location, it could be land. These 
are  all  examples  of  critical  resources.  Similarly,  what  are  the  critical  capabilities  or 
processes?  Examples  of  processes  are  supply  chain  management,  manufacturing, 
operations,  talent  management,  financial  management.  What  is different  about  them 
from resources is that resources are things you can procure, whereas processes and 
capabilities  are  things  you  build  in  your  organisation  through  culture,  role  and 
organisational values. So, these are two fundamental things, which describe how do 
you deliver the customer value proposition. The fourth element is the profit model, which 
is, how do you generate profit? How do you earn revenue, how do you manage your 
cost  structure?  Let's  look  at  a  couple  of  examples  to  understand  how  we  build  a 
business model.  

As a first example, let's consider a well-known company, Apple. I would encourage you 
to follow me along on a sheet of paper and write down four different elements. These 
are the elements of a business model, which we said are, customer value proposition, 
critical  resources,  critical  processes  and  capabilities,  profit  model.  Let's  explain  the 
Apple business model in these terms. Who are Apple's customers? Apple's customers 
are the urban segment, technically literate or digitally savvy, who look at technology as 
an important part of their life, in everything they do. Their work, their entertainment, their 
fitness,  their  being  on  the  move.  So,  Apple  really  looks  at  this  urban  segment. 
Interestingly, they have a high willingness to pay. Apple products are not cheap, but 
because of their focus upon understanding the wants of this urban segment, that's their 
value proposition that they provide seamless online access to content that shapes the 
lives  of  this  segment.  Who  is  the  customer?  Urban  segment,  value  proposition, 
seamless online access to content. How does Apple deliver this? What are its critical 
resources? Most fundamental resource that Apple has is brand.  

Brand is an asset and Apple is among the world's top five brands. Why is the brand an 
asset  and  a  resource?  Because  brand  drives  traffic.  It  lowers  the  cost  of  customer 
acquisition.  Another  important  asset  or  resource  that  Apple  has,  are  their  product 
designers and architects. The world's best product designers choose to work at Apple, 
and they are a critical resource and an asset. Another important asset, a resource, is 
Apple's relationships with the music companies. This is what let them introduce a new 
industry first, which is, selling single songs rather than albums. So, critical resources at 
Apple. What are their critical processes? Apple is legendary for product design, so that's 
a  critical  process.  Apple  does  not  manufacture,  it  outsources,  but  its  process  for 
managing outsourcing relationships, where on a given day, its manufacturers in China 
are shipping almost a million phones out of the airports. So, Apple's ability to manage 
that relationship at cost, quality and value is a critical process.  

 ISB CTO 

2  

 
   
  
  
And finally, Apple has a tight control of sales and marketing, so that's an example of a 
process.  Remember  the  fourth  element  is  a  profit  model,  so  what  is  Apple's  profit 
model?  Apple  focuses  on  high  willingness  to  pay,  which  means  that  the  revenue  is 
generated through high prices and through high margins. That's the key to Apple's profit 
model success. So, hopefully you can see the four elements, and how we have used 
that to describe Apple's strategy.  

Let's  compare  that  with  a  different  company  in  the  retail  space,  Walmart.  Like  most 
retailers, Walmart's value proposition is everyday low price. They serve customers who 
are  looking  for  price  and  value,  who  are  looking  for  large  product  selections  and 
available  product  selections.  But  Walmart  deliberately  chooses  customers  who  are 
price conscious. It does not attract customers who are brand or label conscious, they 
are the ones who go to Macy's. The ones who come to Walmart are price conscious. 
So, that's their 'who is the customer' and the value proposition is 'everyday low price'.  

So, what are the critical resources that Walmart builds to deliver this value proposition? 
First, it is land. Walmart is famous for acquiring large acres of land, building large stores, 
and acquiring  land  when  the  prices are  cheap  so  that they  can  keep  the  cost  of  the 
store  and  the  parking  lots  within  control.  Another  important  resource  at  Walmart  are 
their talent, their IT talent and their people. So, those are examples of critical resources.  

What about processes? Walmart is legendary for supply chain management. They do 
their own supply chain management. They are legendary for merchandising, through 
which  they  maintain  tight  cost  control,  two  critical  processes  for a  retailer.  When  we 
think  about  their  profit  model,  you  will  see  the  contrast  with  Apple.  In  the  case  of 
Walmart, their profit model is built around thin margin, meaning low margin, not high 
margin  in  the  case  of  Apple  and  large  sales  turnover.  So,  thin  margin,  high  volume 
turnover is how they generate their sustainable profit. So, we have seen two examples. 
Let's think about your own company and how would you define your own company's 
business model?  So,  I  encourage  you  to take  another sheet  of  paper, draw the four 
quadrants:  customer  value  proposition,  critical  resource,  critical  processes,  profit 
model. And take a look at how you would generate that business model.  

Video 3: Digital Sweet Spot 

Now that you know how to describe strategy in terms of a business model, the next step 
is, how can we identify opportunities for digital innovation?  

Are there certain sweet spots for digital innovation? I'll introduce you to a framework 
which says that there are three areas of opportunity that will help us identify innovation 
opportunities or the digital sweet spots. They are: first, look at what are you doing with 
your customer and how can you enrich the customer experience. Second, look at your 
core operations, manufacturing, supply chain, warehousing, operations, sales, service 
and how can you streamline, synchronise and improve their effectiveness? Third, can 
you create new products and services? We call them can you create digital products 
and services, digital product and services innovation. And in future videos, we'll explain 
each one of them with some examples.

Video 4: Enriching Customer Experience 

One area of digital innovation sweet spots is to focus upon the customer experience. 
How can you enrich the customer experience?  

What ideas can you generate, and how can you define them as innovation projects? 
Today, with technology, there are numerous ways in which we can enrich the customer 
experience. For example, with mobility and social webs, we can create better reach and 
engagement.  In  retailing  as  an  example,  there  is  a  concept  called  geofencing, 
geolocation, geotargeting. What they all mean is that every customer's smartphone is 
an  opportunity  for  sensing  their  location  and  identifying  opportunities  for  creating 
impulse moments, micro moments. If they are in the vicinity of a store or dealership, 
you can identify them. With smart analytics, you can immediately learn who they are, 
what  they  do,  what  their  needs  are,  preferences  are,  and  can  you  create  a  micro 
moment. Invite them in for their favourite product or service. Starbucks. You walk by a 
Starbucks location. Can they recognise you and offer you your favourite beverage at 
the deal to entice you to walk in? That's what we call creating reach and engagement.  

Similarly,  many  companies  have  a  lot  of  data  about  their  customer. Can  they  derive 
insight from the data and put that at the heart of enriching customer experience? There 
is a credit card company in the US, called Capital One, and they have a very catchy 
campaign and slogan, "What's in your wallet?" What they really have done is they have 
recognised that they have a lot of data about what their customers use the Capital One 
credit  card  for. What  do  they  buy?  So,  based  upon  that  data,  they  can  analyse  and 
identify their preferences. Who are the people like them, what do they buy? And they 
can help them with better deals for a car, for clothes, for music, wine, depending upon 
what their tastes are. So, Capital One is essentially looking at their customers' credit 
card  purchases  as  data,  generating  insights  and  building  greater  value  in  their 
partnership  with  their  customers.  Similarly,  with  the  Internet  of  Things,  the  ability  to 
seamlessly  connect  the  physical  and  the  digital  has  led  to  creating  omnichannel 
experiences. Let's look at a couple of examples. So, I'm going to show you an example 
of a retailer called Old Navy. Now, Old Navy is a retailer which is a mid-quality, mid-
style  retailer.  What  we  mean  by  that  is,  they  are  not  like  Walmart,  where  they  are 
focused on everyday low price and those who are looking for low price. Neither are they 
like Macy's on brand labels and expensive labels. They cater to working professionals 
who still are conscious and attentive to how they dress, but they are attentive to being 
dressed professionally. They frequently like to change their professional dresses, but 
they don't spend a whole lot of money.  

So, think of an example and you will see this in a graphic. Think about a young woman 
who is an Old Navy customer, and she is walking by an Old Navy store. And that's a 
moment for creating reach and engagement. With geofencing, they know it is her, they 
know what her tastes are, and that's a perfect moment to create a micro moment by 
sending her an invitation and a deal, "Some new styles of your professional clothing are 
in. Come on in, try them out." Now, the traditional method is walk among the aisles and 
keep  searching  for  them.  That  might  be  laborious  and  time-consuming.  How  about 
building a digital screen when she walks in, and presenting a virtual display, augmented 

 ISB CTO 

4  

 
   
  
  
reality  of  all  the  new  arrivals  and  having  her  sample  through  them,  click  and  select 
through a touchscreen, the three or four designs that she is interested in.  

What's the next element in a shopping experience? Social advice. So, how about where 
she can easily take snapshots of those designs, Instagram or social media, to have a 
moment of social connection with her friends, confidants, advisors and create a social 
shopping  moment,  where  they  are  giving  her  advice  on  what  she  might  consider, 
because they are familiar with her taste, and they are giving her advice. Assuming that's 
helpful, the next stage is trial. The traditional model is going to a backroom, try it out. 
You may like it, but you may find that it is not in your size. Or some people might find 
that it is such a pain to keep taking off clothes and trying new things. So, how about, 
again  using  augmented  reality  with  a  digital  mirror,  which  actually  can  take  her 
measurements and show her how that particular clothing would look on her, customised 
to her. If she is satisfied and places an order, then automatically you can search in the 
backroom to see if the exact style and the measurements is available. If it is, bring it out 
and  sell.  If  it  is  not,  then  immediately  confirm  the  order  and,  indicate  that  her  exact 
measurement  and  the  dress  will  be  shipped  to  her  home  within  a  certain  amount  of 
time, still taking advantage of that moment.  

What's the next step in that purchase process? She may still want to price compare. 
And when she compares on her mobile phone, she might find, in this example, that at 
Old Navy, the price is $24.99. She can buy it cheaper at Amazon, four dollars cheaper, 
or she  can  spend  more money  or at  Macy's it's four dollars more. The quality  of  the 
shopping  experience  and  the  richness  of  the  experience  that  she  has  had  might  be 
sufficient for her to say, "I am in the moment, I don't know what I am going to get at 
Amazon,  and  what  I  get  at  Old  Navy,  so  it's  still  a  good  deal."  The  next  step  in  the 
purchase process is payment, so supporting it through digital payments. So, what does 
this  example  teach  us?  First,  in  order  to  enrich  the  customer  experience,  map  the 
customer  journey,  understand  the  steps,  enrich  each  step  of  the  process  through 
creative  design  and  technology,  so  that  the  whole  shopping  experience  from  the 
invitation to purchase has been so enriching, that it builds loyalty even in a retail sector, 
which is subject to price competition. So, this is an example of how do you think about 
enriching the customer interface.  

Another  example.  There  is  a  financial  services  company  called  USAA  in  the  United 
States.  They  are  like  any  financial  services  company  except  they  are  unique  in  one 
aspect,  namely,  their  clients  are  only  military  families.  Now  military  families,  they 
frequently get displaced very often. One member of the family goes on long tours or 
duty,  leaving  the  rest  of  the  family  behind.  USAA  is  committed  to  all  their  needs, 
integrated access to banking and financial services. They decided to take this one step 
further by focussing upon two important needs that their customers have: buying cars, 
buying homes. So, they created an app called Home Circle and Auto Circle, through 
which they bring together for buying a home, the real estate consultants, the inspectors, 
the repair people and financing, so that the families can take all the pain out of searching 
for  a  home,  finding  a  trusted  home,  getting  the  maintenance  inspection  done,  and 
getting a loan. Same thing with cars, the Auto Circle. Again, an example of how do you 
enrich the customer experience. So, I hope that these examples and these concepts 

 ISB CTO

help you think about enriching the customer experience as one example of discovering 
the digital innovation sweet spot.  

Video 5: Power of Core Operations 

A  second  area  of  opportunity  in  the  digital  innovation  sweet  spot,  instead  of  the 
customer focus upon your core operations. How can you exploit technology to enhance 
the power of your core operations?  

What does that mean? Generally, firms seek productivity, quality, reliability and cost to 
serve  as  metrics  of  the  effectiveness  of  their  operations.  They  want  to  produce high 
quality, but at the same time, they want to keep the cost of production under control. 
The challenge is, increasingly, the same companies want to serve their customers with 
personalisation and customisation. So, there is a fundamental tension. The more you 
customise at the customer end, the more costly it is to produce that product variety. So, 
the  dilemma  is  how  can  we  synchronise  our  operations  for  standardisation,  quality, 
productivity  and  cost  control.  while  still  serving  variety  and  customisation  at  the 
frontend?  How  do  you  balance  standardisation  and  variety?  Today,  companies  are 
beginning to examine how technologies can help us with that. A great example is Asian 
Paints. Asian Paints is an incumbent paint manufacturer. They have existed for many 
years, and they excel at paint production. In order to produce paint with high quality, 
reliability  and  low  cost,  they  standardise  upon  the  number  of  colours  that  they 
manufacture. So, let's say they manufacture 10 colours, they can deliver them very cost 
effectively with high reliability and quality. The traditional model has been sell indirectly 
to the customers through the dealership network. The challenge for Asian Paints was, 
that their customers no longer wanted to simply buy paint. As they became affluent, as 
they began to own homes, what they wanted to do was build a decor, which is build an 
ambience by painting their walls in a unique shade that reflects their personality, their 
choice, that reflects the furniture that they have. And the ten colours that Asian Paints 
sells, was not good enough for them.  

So, the challenge facing Asian Paints was, here is the business opportunity to enrich 
the customer interface by not selling  paint but helping them design decor. But if that 
means, selling 150 different shades of paint, it is expensive. It is not sustainable from 
an operations point of view. So, how do you do this? So, their brilliant solution was to 
create a field sales force and empower them with iPads. So, imagine a field salesperson 
going to a customer's home or apartment and giving them an iPad and saying here are 
the 10 colours we manufacture, but you can design your own shade on this iPad. So, 
go ahead and create your own unique combination by mixing and matching these ten 
colours, which is the equivalent of saying the customer is now the co-designer, the co-
creator of their decor. Maybe their whole family gets involved with and they create a 
shade that is unique and satisfying. They can then hold up the iPad against the wall, 
against their furniture to see if this is the right shade that we want. Once they are settled 
on  it,  the  iPad  can  capture  how  did  we  produce  the  shade,  what  combination  of  10 
colours  and  in  what  percentages  resulted  in  the  shade,  and  you  can  automatically 
capture  that.  The  next  question  is  how  much  paint  do  you  need?  Again,  remember 
augmented reality. Hold that iPad up against the walls, and it can automatically measure 

 ISB CTO 

6  

 
   
  
  
the  dimensions,  and  estimate  what  is  the  total  volume  and  translate  that  into  what 
number of cans of red, how many cans of green, how many cans of yellow and so on. 
And also, create the mixing instructions and the directions for buying the paint. At that 
moment, the customer can either tell the salesperson, can you order this for me, or go 
to a painter and give them that slip and say this is the shade, these are the instructions, 
do it, or go to the dealer give them that slip, they will create the mix, mix the shade, give 
them  instructions  and  paintbrushes  and  they  can  go  home.  It  is  a  brilliant  way  of 
applying digital innovation to solve a fundamental tension, and Asian Paints increased 
their  market  penetration,  while  still  being  able  to  hold  the  cost  and  productivity.  10 
paints, 150 decors made possible through the power of digital innovation.  

Another  way  of  thinking  about  core  operations  is  balancing  control  and  innovation. 
Innovation  requires  experiments.  Experiments  are  risky.  Experiments  can  go  out  of 
control. So, how do you allow freedom to experiment, while still maintaining control? 
So, think about mobile apps or websites. Those are platforms for customer experiments, 
but  at  the  same  time  they  provide  enough  control  guides  to  make  sure  that  the 
experiments don't bankrupt the company or damage the company's reputation. Amazon 
does many experiments, but within the framework of its website or apps so that there's 
still some control. Another way of thinking about core operations is understanding the 
pain points and how technology can do better.  

Let me share with you an example to illustrate these concepts. There is a British grocery 
retailer called Tesco, a dominant retailer in the Europe and UK. When they decided to 
enter the Korean market, they realised that there were barriers to entry. And what were 
they? When you think about Korea, what's the first thing that comes to mind? It is an 
island. Land is scarce, land is limited. The density of land occupation is such that there 
is very little land available, or whatever is available is expensive. Why does that matter 
for a grocery store? Because they need land, they need land to build a giant grocery 
store to display what they have and attract customers. So, Tesco realised that already 
the barrier to entry was high because they could not get quite land, or the land would 
be so expensive that their costs would be very high. So, what do they do?  

As they started thinking about Korea, they realised something else about Korea. You 
may guess that Korea is one of the most digitally advanced country. People have 5G 
phones and they have the latest technologies in the form of smartphones. Secondly, 
most  people  in  Korea  don't  drive,  they  take  the  train  to  work  because  driving  is 
expensive  with  limited  parking  spots.  So  as  a  result,  a  lot  of  their  daily  lives  are 
organised  around  train  stations  and  trains.  That  led  to  a  brilliant  idea  at  Tesco.  A 
wallpaper pasted on the walls of a train station displaying all the products that Tesco is 
selling. And people can walk up to what they want to buy, use their smartphone, scan 
in the QR code. At the operations end, Tesco operations can consolidate the shopping 
basket.  The  customer  can  also  indicate  when  they  want  this  to  be  delivered.  And 
through geotagging or geolocation, the operation centre can sense when the customer 
is headed home, and they can ensure and synchronise in such a way that the shopping 
basket is delivered at their doorstep the moment they are there, because people don't 
want their groceries to be sitting on the doorstep for long hours. This was a brilliant way 
of using digital innovation to create a virtual grocery store, synchronised with a giant 

 ISB CTO

operation  centre  using  geosensing  to  synchronise  delivery,  and  very  quickly,  Tesco 
landed into the number two spot. So, I hope that this example inspires you to think about 
how do you think about digital innovation and the power of core operations?  

Video 6: Digital Product and Services Innovation 

A third way of thinking about digital innovation sweet spots is to think about product and 
service innovation. Can you identify new opportunities for product innovation?  

Remember, earlier we said reimagine your business around the customer, not around 
the product or service that you are currently selling. So, in that spirit, can you think about 
not selling standalone products, but think about consumption platforms, meaning that 
what other things does the customer need along with your product and service? What 
makes that consumption complete? Can you provide them with smart context for their 
consumption? Let's think about an example. The example is Nike. Nike sells sneakers 
and  their  sneakers  are  expensive.  People  who  buy  Nike  sneakers  have  a  high 
willingness to pay. As Nike started understanding their customer and what do they do 
with the sneakers, they realised that one significant segment of people who buy their 
sneakers are fitness freaks. People who run, people who keep track of their statistics, 
like how many miles did I run, where did I run, what was my heartbeat, pulse, and all of 
that. They are members of communities which like to brag about their fitness, but they 
also like to share that data with their doctor. That's their lifestyle. That realisation led 
Nike to realise what they were not selling are sneakers, what they were selling were 
fitness platforms.  

So, they embedded a Bluetooth into their sneaker, and that Bluetooth syncs with the 
smartphone that the runner has, through which they can listen to music. They can track 
their running, they can track their pulse, heartbeat, and they can build a record of the 
vital signs, which they can post on to social community or which they can share with 
their  doctor.  So,  a  great  example  of  taking  a  standalone  product,  understanding  the 
context of its consumption and creating a consumption platform in the shape of a fitness 
and health platform, not a sneaker, fitness and health platform. So, I hope this gives 
you  an  example,  an  inspiration  for  how  you  think  about  digital  product  and  service 
innovation.  

Video 7: ING Case Study 

How can you apply some of the principles and lessons that we have talked about as an 
innovation catalyst?  

I am going to illustrate the concepts through the case study of ING, which is a legacy 
incumbent firm. When they looked at their emerging competition, and they looked at the 
digital  giants  and  tech  entrepreneurs,  they  realised  that  there  were  four  important 
challenges on the road to digital transformation. First, consumers had high expectations 
from that bank. Consumers wanted the same type of experience that they experienced 
with other consumer firms. For example, they wanted the Amazon type of experience 
with ING. They wanted the experience that they got from FinTechs and from the digital 
giants. So, this was a big change for ING, which was not built for that kind of experience, 

 ISB CTO 

8  

 
   
  
  
particularly with the rise of the digital natives. Digital natives are the millennials. Their 
parents are very different. And so, ING realised that while they had made investments 
in  branch  offices  and  ATMs,  the  expectation  from  the  millennials  was,  'Banking  is 
important to our life, but we don't need to go to the bank.' So, how do you bring the bank 
to  the  customer  whereas  the  traditional model  had  been  the  customer  comes  to  the 
bank? Third, as an opportunity with the rise of mobility and Internet and the cloud, how 
do you build a platform of opportunities that takes advantage of smart, mobile, analytics 
and  cloud?  And  then  of  course,  there  was  a  rising  tide  of  regulations  to  protect  the 
consumer interests.  

So, a dilemma of how do you use the data while still respecting the rights of privacy and 
regulation? So, what was their digital vision? It was to be clear and easy with an anytime 
anywhere service offering that makes the customers make smart decisions and keep 
getting better. How did they do this? Once again, they identified enriching the customer 
interface  as  the  digital  innovation  sweet  spot.  So,  in  order  to  enrich  the  customer 
experience, they focused on launching a new mobile management application in  the 
UK in 2017. This application was called Yolt, and it allowed the users to manage their 
financial holdings across different institutions.  

Similarly, they were among the earliest to experiment with a voice-driven AI interface 
called  Ginger,  which  would  enhance  the  customer's  experience  by  enabling  voice 
payments. And third, in order to build a new ecosystem, they created a €300 million 
fund to invest in FinTechs and they created about 110 partnerships. So, what do we 
learn from this case? Once again, the importance of the business model, identifying the 
innovation sweet spot, here, enrich the customer offering. looking at different ways in 
which those interfaces can be enriched through mobile app, through a voice-driven AI. 
And then of course, recognising that there is a need for a new ecosystem and therefore 
becoming  a  venture  capitalist  and  investing  in  startups  either  to  learn  from  their 
experiments or in the future to acquire the ones which seem very promising.  

Video 8: DBS Case Study 

Let's look at the example of a bank called DBS, to understand some of the concepts 
that we have talked about the innovation catalyst role, how do you spur innovation and 
how a CTO could help in some of those conversations. So, DBS is a bank in Singapore. 
It has a history of being in the banking sector. And one of the challenges was that its 
customers were becoming younger and younger. We talked about the digital natives, 
but at the same time, unfortunately for the company, it was perceived a bureaucratic, 
slow and too many rules and procedures. So, the digital vision at DBS was to be clear 
and easy, with an anytime, anywhere service offering that would make customers, make 
smart decisions and keep getting better. In other words, their motto was, "How can we 
make banking joyful?"  

And in looking at their business model, they identified three principles. First, be digital 
to the core. Now remember, this is a traditional bank, that was not necessarily the case 
with them. They used technology primarily for back-office functions and now their new 
goal was digital to  the  core.  Everything  we do  in  transactions  with  our  customers, in 
how we operate and all the things.

Secondly, be customer obsessed rather than being inside out, meaning that we design 
products, and we offer them to customers. If you remember, we said the new rule is 
imagine  your  business  or  reimagine  your  business  around  your  customer.  So,  be 
customer obsessed. Look at yourself from the outside in. Look at yourself through the 
eyes  of  your customer  and  what  do  they  expect? What  will  they want  if  you  want to 
make banking joyful? And third, for a legacy organisation with a rich background and 
past, how do you now create a start-up culture? How do you start building a culture of 
risk taking and experimentation? So, what did they do? They needed an inspiring vision, 
and that inspiring vision was to be the D in GANDALF. For those of you who are Lord 
of the Rings fans, this is a reference you will easily relate to, Gandalf, the wise wizard. 
But here, GANDALF means something slightly different, but it is a clever play on the 
pun, again, to inspire people. GANDALF stands for: G is Google, A is Apple, N is Netflix, 
again, A is Amazon, L is LinkedIn, and F is Facebook. Take a moment to think about 
what's common among all these companies. And if you said that they are digital to the 
core, you would be right.  

So, DBS's vision was, we should be spoken of, in the same league as these technology 
companies. We are the D in GANDALF, which is a way of saying don't look at other 
banks but look at these technology companies because that's how we get digital to the 
core, that's how we get customer obsessed and that's how we build a start-up culture. 
So, compare yourself with technology companies, not banks. Shift from specific projects 
to a platform. Organise for success through agile processes. Automate as much as you 
can so that you can be fast, and design for modern systems. These are a couple of 
ideas we will connect back when we talk about the role of the CTO as a technology 
architect. Now, what was the result? The transformation was to embed themselves in 
the customer journey. They launched Digibank, which is the first mobile-only banking 
app. They were among the first to bring a banking app to the market. That was a huge 
transformation for what was an incumbent legacy banking firm perceived as slow and 
boring.  So,  what  were  the  lessons  learned?  Their  business  model  itself  was 
fundamentally sound, but they identified, enriched the customer interface as their digital 
innovation sweet spot. And in order to enrich that customer interface, they realised that 
they needed  to  be  the  D in  GANDALF.  They  needed  to  be  customer-obsessed,  and 
they needed to be digital to the core and they needed to build an entrepreneurial culture. 
Ideas to think about through this case study of the digital transformation at DBS.    

Video 9: Module Summary 

And we can say that the first step is to focus on understanding the business model. You 
will recall that the business model has four components as a tool: What is the value 
proposition?  What  are  the  critical  resources?  What  are  the  critical  processes  and 
capabilities,  and  what  is  the  profit  model?  So,  start  with  understanding  the  business 
model. Then, in looking at this business model, what are the innovation sweet spots? 
We  said  those  sweet  spots  are  enrich  the  customer  interface,  synchronise  core 
operations, and third is create new products and services. I hope that this framework 
helps  you  as  you  think  about  your  own  organisation  as  you  test  your  skills  about 
becoming an innovation catalyst.
