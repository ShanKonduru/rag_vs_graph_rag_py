Week 3: CTO as Innovation Catalyst: Discovering Innovation 
Opportunities 

To effectively drive innovation, a Chief Technology Officer must possess the ability to 
identify digital innovation sweet spots. But what exactly are these sweet spots? Let us 
begin by understanding the concept of business models and their role in this context.  

Business Models 

A business model serves as a valuable and fundamentally important tool that allows us 
to comprehend a firm's strategy. It enables us to understand how a company generates 
value  in a  sustainable  manner and  serves as  a  basis  for identifying  opportunities  for 
digital innovation. This tool provides a comprehensive approach to describing a firm's 
business strategy in a practical and actionable manner. Within a business model, there 
are four crucial components that play a significant role: the customer value proposition, 
critical resources, critical processes and capabilities, and the profit model. Let's explore 
each component in detail. 

Customer Value Proposition 

The customer value proposition lies at the core of a business model and involves asking 
three important questions: 

•  Who is the customer?  

It is crucial to identify who the customer is, ensuring a laser-focused approach 
that distinguishes the target audience from those who are not part of it.  

•  How to build a strong relationship with the customer? 

This  can  be  achieved  by  delivering  superior  value,  whether  through  product 
innovation, cost-effective solutions, or in-depth knowledge of customer needs.  

•  What are the important ways to deliver value to the customer?  

The  value  proposition  should  be  based  on  meeting  and  exceeding  customer 
needs, including both delivered and latent needs, in a superior manner. 

Critical Resources, Processes and Capabilities 

Once the value proposition is established, the next step is to consider how to deliver it 
in a superior and sustainable manner. This is accomplished through the identification 
of critical resources, processes and capabilities.  

•  Critical resources refer to the assets that the firm invests in, such as human 

talent, brand reputation, physical locations, and land.  

•  Critical  processes  and  capabilities  are  developed  within  the  organisation 

through culture, roles, and organisational values.  
Examples  of  critical  processes 
manufacturing, operations, talent management, and financial management. 

include  supply  chain  management, 

These  components  are  fundamental  to  effectively  delivering  the  customer  value 
proposition.

Profit Model 

The  profit  model  encompasses  how  a  firm  generates  profit,  earns  revenue,  and 
manages its cost structure. It is essential to consider the sustainability and profitability 
of  the  business.  This  involves  analysing  pricing  strategies,  revenue  streams,  cost 
management, and margin optimisation. By focusing on a profit model that aligns with 
the overall business strategy, a company can ensure financial success and long-term 
viability. 

Exploring Examples: Apple and Walmart 

To  illustrate  the  application  of  a  business  model,  let's  consider  two  well-known 
companies: Apple and Walmart.

Digital Sweet Spot 

Having understood how to describe a strategy using a business model, the next crucial 
step is identifying opportunities for digital innovation. This is done by identifying specific 
areas that serve as sweet spots for digital innovation. These areas include  

•  Enriching the customer experience 
•  Optimising core operations 
•  Creating digital products and services.  

Enriching the Customer Experience 

By focusing on your interactions with customers, you can identify ways to enrich their 
experience  through  digital  innovation.  This  may  involve  leveraging  technology  to 
improve convenience, personalisation or engagement with customers. Enhancing the 
customer  experience  can  lead  to  increased  customer  satisfaction,  loyalty  and 
ultimately, business growth. 

Businesses  can  leverage  technology  to  enhance  the  customer  journey  and  create 
meaningful interactions. This can include various strategies, such as geofencing, data-
driven insights, omnichannel experiences, augmented reality, social connections and 
seamless  digital  payments.  By  focusing  on  enriching  each  step  of  the  customer 
interface,  businesses  can  foster  loyalty  and  differentiate  themselves  in  competitive 
markets.  

•  Reach and Engagement 

Geofencing,  geolocation  and  geotargeting  provide  opportunities  to  create 
personalised micro moments for customers.  

These tactics build reach and engagement, capturing the customer's attention 
and increasing the likelihood of a visit. 

•  Customer Data Insights 

Companies with vast customer data can derive valuable insights to enhance the 
customer experience. By leveraging this data-driven approach, businesses can

provide tailored recommendations and deliver greater value to their customers, 
ultimately building stronger partnerships. 

• 

Internet of Things 
The Internet of Things enables seamless integration between physical and digital 
realms, leading to the creation of omnichannel experiences. Here’s an example 
of a retail customer experience: 

Optimising Core Operations 

Core  operations  encompass  activities  such  as  manufacturing,  supply  chain 
management,  warehousing,  sales  and  service.  By  streamlining  and  synchronising 
these operations, businesses can enhance their efficiency and effectiveness.  

Digital  innovation  plays  a  significant  role  in  this  optimisation  process,  enabling 
automation,  real-time  data  analysis,  predictive  analytics  and  process  optimisation. 
Improving  core  operations  through  digital  innovation  can  result  in  cost  savings, 
improved productivity and better overall performance. 

•  Standardisation and Empowerment: 

Companies  strive  for  productivity,  quality,  reliability,  and  cost  control  as 
indicators  of  operational  effectiveness.  They  aim  to  produce  high-quality 
products while keeping production costs under control. However, the challenge 
arises  when  customers  demand  personalisation  and  customisation,  which 
increases the cost of producing a wide variety of products.  Today, companies 
are  turning  to  technology  to  address  this  challenge  and  achieve  operational 
synchronisation. 

Example:  Asian  Paints  used  augmented  reality  to  enhance  their  customer 
interface,  which  led  to  increased  market  penetration  while  maintaining  cost-
effectiveness and productivity.

•  Balance Control with Innovation 

Control and innovation can often be seen as opposing forces. Innovation is risky 
but  companies  must  balance  freedom  to  experiment  and  necessary  controls. 
Customer experiments can be conducted on platforms such as mobile apps and 
websites  as  these  provide  a  controlled  environment  for  innovation  to  thrive 
without endangering the company's financial stability or reputation. 

•  Orchestrate and Unleash 

Understanding  pain  points  in  core  operations  and  leveraging  technology  to 
overcome them is key to digital innovation.  

Example: Tesco used an innovative approach to overcome the land constraints 
in  Korea  and  quickly  established  itself  as  a  top  competitor.  It  recognised  that 
Korea  had  a  highly  digitised  population,  with  many  people  relying  on 
smartphones  and  public  transportation.  The  company  created  virtual  grocery 
stores in train stations, displaying products on wallpaper. Customers could use 
their  smartphones  to  scan  QR  codes  and  place  orders,  which  were  then 
consolidated and synchronised for delivery.  

Creating Digital Products and Services Innovation 

It is essential to reimagine the business around the customer instead of focusing only 
on  the  products  or services.  This will  allow the  business to  identify  new avenues  for 
innovation and meet customers' evolving needs.  To do this businesses can consider 
shifting  from  selling  standalone  products  to  providing  consumption  platforms  that 
enhance the customer experience. For this approach businesses must consider  

•  What other elements are needed to complete the consumption process  
•  How  to  provide  smart  context  to  enrich  the  customer's  interaction  with  the 

product or service. 

Example:  Nike  transformed  their  sneakers  into  a  comprehensive  fitness  and  health 
platform by integrating Bluetooth technology into their sneakers which was synced with 
the  runner's  smartphone.  By  leveraging  this  digital  innovation  Nike  met  the  broader 
needs and aspirations of their customers.   

Driving Digital Innovation 

To understand how to apply the principles and lessons of the CTO being an innovation 
catalyst, let us look at ING, a legacy incumbent firm 

• 

ING faced four key challenges in their digital transformation journey: 

o  Consumers had high expectations and desired the same experience as 

other consumer firms. 

o  Millennials,  the  digital  natives,  had  different  banking  preferences  and 

o 

didn't rely on physical branches. 
It was crucial to build a platform of opportunities to leverage smart, mobile, 
analytics, and cloud technologies.

o 

It was a challenge to balance data usage with privacy regulations. 
ING's  digital  vision  focused  on  providing  clear  and  easy  anytime,  anywhere 
services for smart decision-making.  

•  The digital innovation sweet spot identified was enriching the customer interface. 

To achieve this ING did the following: 

o  Launched Yolt, a mobile management application that allowed users to 

manage their finances across institutions. 

o  Experimented  with  Ginger,  a  voice-driven  AI  interface  for  enhanced 

customer experiences and voice payments. 

o  Created a €300 million fund and established 110 partnerships to build a 

new ecosystem. 

ING  recognised  the  need  for  a  new  ecosystem  and  became  a  venture  capitalist, 
investing in startups for learning and future acquisition opportunities. 

Next let us look at DBS, a bank in Singapore to understand how to spur innovation and 
how a CTO could help in some of those conversations 

•  DBS faced the challenge of attracting younger customers while being perceived 

as bureaucratic and slow. 

•  Their  digital  vision  was  to  provide  clear and  easy  anytime,  anywhere  banking 

services that make smart decisions and bring joy to customers. 

•  The bank identified three principles for their business model transformation: 

o  Being digital to the core 
o  Customer obsession 
o  Creating a start-up culture. 

•  They aimed to be the "D" in GANDALF, comparing themselves to digital giants 
like Google, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The goal was to  

o  Shift from specific projects to a platform 
o  Embrace agile processes,  
o  Automate tasks for speed 
o  Design modern systems. 

•  DBS  launched  Digibank,  the  first  mobile-only  banking  app,  by  which  they 
embedded themselves in the customer journey and transformed their image. 

DBS identified the customer interface as the digital innovation sweet spot, strived to be 
customer-obsessed and digital to the core.to achieve its digital transformation.  

Key Steps and Responsibilities of a CTO 

To drive digital transformation and foster innovation, the CTO’s role as an innovation 
catalyst is crucial. The CTO should  

•  Focus on comprehending the organisation's business model 

This  includes  identifying  the  value  proposition,  critical  resources,  critical 
processes and capabilities and the profit model and this understanding provides 
a foundation for strategic decision-making.

and  creating  new  products  and  services  and  recognising  these  areas  of 
opportunity sets the direction for innovation initiatives. 

•  Bring expertise in technology, market trends, and emerging tools to drive 

innovation.  
CTOs  must  stay  updated  with  industry  advancements,  assess  the  potential 
impact  on  the  organisation  and  apply  their  knowledge  to  guide  technological 
investments and decision-making.\ 

•  Play a key role in cultivating a culture of innovation within the organisation 
This involves promoting risk-taking, encouraging experimentation and creating 
an  environment that  values  and  rewards  innovative  ideas.  They  can  establish 
innovation  frameworks,  processes  and  collaboration  channels  to  support  idea 
generation and implementation. 

•  Collaborate with various stakeholders to effectively drive innovation 

Stakeholders  include  business  leaders,  cross-functional  teams  and  external 
partners. By fostering strong relationships and understanding business needs, 
the  CTO  can  align  technology  initiatives  with  strategic  objectives  and  drive 
innovation projects forward.
