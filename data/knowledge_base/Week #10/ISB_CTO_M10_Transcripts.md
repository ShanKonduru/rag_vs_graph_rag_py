Week 10: Cybersecurity, Cyber and Tech Laws 

Video 1: Technology Laws in India 

When we talk about Industry 5.0, one thing that it did was that it is started connecting 
different pieces through the sensors. Now, it gave lots and lots of good results because 
we could improve processes, we can optimise data and so on. Many companies have 
implemented  Industry  5.0  to  totally  revolutionise  either  their  logistics,  or  their 
warehouses, or the whole business. But it created a new kind of challenges that people 
did not realise. First, when all the data being connected to each other, there is an issue 
of data leakage. So, it can go to the people where it should not have gone. That is the 
first thing. And second thing is that that it is open to now cyber attacks because earlier 
many of this manufacturing and logistic things were not connected through Internet. But 
since they are connected, the hacker can also get it. 

And the challenge becomes even more tricky because many times in such situation the 
data  is  travelling  across  countries.  So,  both  cybersecurity  and  the  laws  around  it 
become critical when we think of Industry 5.0. So, let us try to understand that how they 
go hand-in-hand, what this countries are doing in terms of their tech laws and what can 
we do with cybersecurity. Where do we stand with cybersecurity and what can really be 
done about that? Can we do something about it? So, let us first begin with the tech laws 
in India, US, UK and other countries. So, you know, first thing which is very interesting 
and as of 2023, it is being discussed right now, the details and ready to be implemented 
soon is Digital India Act. Digital India Act has lot of promise, and it is designed to replace 
the IT Act of 2000, which was mainly designed for e-commerce transit. 

Now see, we are talking here that generative AI can generate content which we have 
never seen. We are talking about blockchains can store data and videos that we had 
never seen earlier, across supply chain. We can see mass customisation. All of these 
things are new. So, clearly the act needs to move fast enough. Every country, I think 
the  act  is  lagging  behind,  that  is  why  when  generative  AI  started  creating  music  or 
videos of people in their own voice music, the court had no clue what to do because we 
do not have laws there. So, Digital India Act really is what it claims is that it can replace 
IT Act. It will apply to lot of different things, and it comes with lot of controversy as well. 
So, one piece which is being critical part of Digital India Act is freedom of expression. 

So, social media platform should not decide who can speak what. They cannot regulate 
the freedom of expression. Everybody should have right to the freedom of expression, 
and this was brought in in the earlier modifications as well in the earlier IT rules,  that 
some of the freedom of expression part should have come. And for that the committee 
has now been established to look at the complaints by social media users, if they feel 
that the social media organisations are curbing their freedom of expression. This is a 
very interesting part of the bill and how it will change because you know, whole social 
media is a big deal right now. Second piece which is being considered now is online 

 ISB CTO

safety. So, this act will cover AI, deepfake. Deepfake is the name where you can create 
the real looking videos or images. 

Those are deepfakes which even experts may not even sometimes recognise. It is also 
for cybersecurity. That is another place where it is getting going to get covered, and 
also, it has a lot of data protection part is coming. Now this is where it is very nicely 
comparing with other countries, which I am going to talk now, and the government has 
put in a draft for Digital Personal Data Protection Bill in 2022, and there is a National 
Data Grievance Policy, and these are all going to be connected with this Digital India 
Act  and  another  piece  that  is  being  considered  is  called  safe  harbour.  Now,  in  the 
cyberspace,  the  government  is  trying  to  reconsider  the  key  aspect,  which  is  safe 
harbour. Safe harbour, basically it is that it allows social media platform to avoid any 
liability of the post made by users. 

Safe harbour was created to make sure that online like social media companies are not 
penalised or blamed for what their users are doing because then they can't do anything. 
But worldwide this whole perspective is changing and there are several examples of 
that.  One  example  is  when  Facebook  had  the  Big  Britannica  scandal  where  this 
company came and stole data of several Facebook users. Facebook did not sell that 
data. Facebook could have stopped stealing the data, but they did not do it and we have 
reasonable doubt they knew about it, but they did not do it. Now the question comes 
that safe harbour would say that oh, they should not be touched because they did not 
do anything wrong. But then there is a problem here, both ethical and legal problem 
because so many people got duped in the process. 

Another very interesting thing is that Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, which is also 
as  of  2023  being  discussed.  So,  it  applies  to  the  processing  of  digital  personal  data 
within India where such data is collected online or collected offline and digitised. So, 
the question is that if a data is collected in India, can it travel outside India? I will talk 
about what other countries have opinion on that. It will also apply to processing data 
outside India, but they had providing goods or services in India. So, personal data may 
be processed only for a lawful purpose for which an individual has given consent. That 
is what the bill is talking about. They cannot just take the data and do it. And that goes 
back to Web 3.0. Web 3.0 says that the data should be owned by the creator of the 
data, which is user, not the company who is storing and owning the data. 

So,  that  is  just  very  interesting  and  important.  And  data  fiduciary  is  defined  as  any 
person  ,who  alone  or  in  conjunction  with  other  person  determines  the  purpose  and 
means  of  processing  of  personal  data.  So,  they  should  be  obliged  to  maintain  the 
accuracy of the data and security of the data. Those days are gone when if targets were 
attacked, and they lost lot of customer data, and we all were feeling bad for target. Now 
with  the  new  law  around  the  worldwide,  they  will  be  penalised  that  you  could  not 
safeguard the data. So, the new laws that are coming, these are being rewritten and 
redefined, that will change the whole IT industry in general, but especially around how 
data is saved, how data is stored, how data is choosed and it will touch a lot on the 
social media and so on. 

 ISB CTO

So, the bill here, this will grant certain right to  individual, including the right to obtain 
information,  seek  correction  and  all  the  grievance  rendition.  So,  it  gives  them  some 
power back in the hand of the users, which is fantastic. You know, this is where every 
country  is  struggling  that  how  much  they  can  do  for  their  consumers.  There  was  a 
documentary at Netflix called Social Dilemma, which they talked about that how by the 
process called data harvesting by all the social media companies including Meta and 
Twitter and not so much LinkedIn though, but both Meta and Twitter. They take the data 
and harvest the data in a way and use the data to make people addict. Now, this is a 
dangerous  route  to  go  on  how  this  data  is  being  used  because  they  are  using  it  for 
completely their own purpose, not for consumer welfare. So, some of these bills and 
these bills will also connect to all the new developments in generative AI because that 
is where lot of sticky point is coming.  

Video 2: Technology Laws in Other Developed Countries 

Now, let us look at data protection laws in other countries. If you look at the European 
Union,  they  have  well  known  GDPR,  which  is  called  General  Data  Protection 
Regulation, and that is one of the strictest in the world in terms of how the data can 
move. So, GDPR basically says that any data belonging to a European Union cannot 
go outside the country. Now that creates or cannot be misused. If you have a data from 
European Union, you have to store in a different way. There have been lot of debates 
on that. In fact, when GDPR was implemented, some of the companies like New York 
Times and all, they closed down their offices in European Union because they realised 
that they can't deal with it, follow all the rules of that. But here the right to privacy is 
enriched as a fundamental right that seeks to protect the individuals all data and right 
they have to maintain the data. Now Meta has been fined $1.3 billion for violating this 
rule. Now that is that is very interesting. And this is certainly a big fine and one of the 
biggest  fine  and  this  fine  is  about  not  following  this  rule  carefully.  So,  it  will  be  very 
interesting to see how the future emerge.  

Now, US model has been on the different end. US does not have comprehensive set of 
privacy rights of principles. It is very case by case basis, very sector specific regulations. 
In some sectors you can do it, some sectors you cannot do it. That has been approach 
of US data policies for long time. They tried to do it where you can use. For example, 
when  generative  AI  started  creating  lot  of  this  fake  images  and  videos,  some  states 
they told that it cannot be used for election purposes. So, context dependent. You can 
use  it  other  purposes,  but  not  for  election  purposes.  You  cannot  create  this  images 
using algorithm or videos using algorithm of politician. And that also happened in certain 
states, not everywhere. So, those kind of things, we will see more and more happening. 
China, China has done several interesting things.  

China  laws  on  that data  privacy  and  security  include  personal information  protection 
law, PIPL and it came into effect in November 2021 and basically China did very similar 
thing. What is happening in India that you cannot take the data out of China or whatever 
is  generated  in  China.  Okay.  And  this  data  security  law  which  came  into  force  in 
September 2021, that was the main which required the data to stay there, and this was 
during COVID and who was going and sitting in China to discuss with the government 

 ISB CTO 

3  

 
   
  
  
on that Elon Musk. Why Elon Musk? Because Elon Musk's car cannot drive on its own 
if the cars do not get the data from all the places.  

Now, China is one of the largest markets for Tesla, and Elon Musk was worried that if 
China data can only stay in China, then the power of learning will go down substantially. 
And these are the kind of things which this law requires the challenge. On one hand, 
we want to create a system which is holistic, where all the collaboration is happening, 
data  can  be  shared  so  that  machines  can  do  a  better  job  and  we  can  improve  as  a 
human society. On the other hand, the countries are thinking that my data is my data, 
and it should not go out. The privacy of my customers is very important.  

Similar thing happened when the TikTok data was discussed in the US, it was realised 
that some of the TikTok data from the US was being sent to Chinese government and 
that created lot of dissatisfaction. So, whatever rule we pick there will be pros and cons. 
If you are very flexible like US is in most cases then they are very likely their customers 
data can be misused. If you take something like European Union, or China model then 
you make it too restrictive which not only going to hurt the companies and the society 
possibly but certainly some of the companies discouraged to come to the country. So, 
this is something that is ongoing thing, it is not going to get resolved but at least having 
a  good  definition  and  writing  is  removing  lot  of  ambiguity  in  the  process.  Right  now, 
there is a lot of ambiguity, nobody knows what should be the outcome. Now, once it is 
written, we know what it is, then we can deal with it. 

Video 3: Cyberattacks: Trends 

So,  this  whole  discussion  has  started  with  the  emergence  of  Web  3.0,  Industry  5.0, 
generative AI, the social media and then comes the cyber security. All of this has led to 
lot of cyberattacks. So, countries are free writing their cyber laws as well and new cyber 
security methods are coming. Now when we think of cyberattacks, there have been lot 
of growing randomness in victim selection. In the past, the cyberattacks used to happen 
with large companies like AT&T. Now in recent past, the targeting is very random. Many 
small firms have been targeted and why small firms are being targeted because they 
have lower security. So, there is a reason for that. But that was not the case earlier. 

So, there is a ransomware task now. Ransomware is the kind of attack which is right 
now one of the most commonly used cyberattack by the hackers. And how ransomware 
works is very simple. The here the hacker is not claiming to steal your data or change 
your data. They lock your data. It is like somebody lock you out of your house and then 
they say that I will let you in only if you pay me money. It is very much like kidnapping. 
Now this is become a headache for law agency across the world but especially FBI. 
They are trying very hard to fix this and this is not an easy problem to solve because 
many of these attacks are originated from the countries where we do not have proper 
control.  Now  there  was  a  ransomware  task  force  created  and  this  task  force  they 
showed that in 2021 businesses with fewer than 500 employees were hit by 70% of the 
attack,  which  is  amazing  because  it  is  very different  from  what  we  have  seen  in  the 
past. So, you know, partly because their security is weak but also it changes the whole 
thing. 

 ISB CTO 

4  

 
   
  
  
And one of the thing is that there is a lot of malevolence is growing, you know, ill intent. 
I just want to cause damage. Lot of hackers have just they just want to create some 
kind of nuisance and that is becoming the norm. A lot of industrial espionage, criminal 
intent  activism  where  you  try  to  try  to  hang  the  system  and  get  something  out  of  it, 
terrorism, all of these are coming with cyberattack and big reason has been because of 
the  growth  of  IoT  and  all  this  industry  5.0,  4.0,  because  they  are  connecting  all  the 
pieces together. So, they are open to exposure. You know that is one of the risk with all 
these  autonomous  vehicles  as  well.  What  if  there  is  a  cycle  attack  on  autonomous 
vehicles  which are driving  on their own,  then  somebody  can take over and  they  can 
drive. It can be very dangerous, although there are lot of protocols to avoid that. But 
this  is  not  a  totally  unrealistic  scenario.  So,  when  we  go  into  the  world  of  lot  of 
connectivity, we are going to bound to have this kind of problems. So, cyber warfare is 
basically  defined  as  any  action  to  deny,  exploit,  corrupt  or  destroy  the  enemy's 
information  and  its  function  while  at  the  same  time  protecting  oneself  against  those 
same actions. That is the cyber warfare, and we are seeing that happening, which is, 
which can be very, very dangerous. So, when we talk about all this attack, the attacks 
are more and more automated rather than human directed. That is the one thing that 
has happened. Viruses and worms are attack robots that travel among computers and 
that  can  attack  many  computers  in  minutes  or  hours.  So,  they  are  basically  cyber 
weapons of mass destruction that is what they are. And lot of AI and machine learning 
is being used in attacks. So, we are trying to use AI machine learning to stop attacks 
but understand that these attacks are also generated by them. They can also do bad 
things, which many of the researcher including Hinton who is the father of modern AI is 
claiming  now  that  these  things  have  lot  of  negative  uses  and  even  more  than  the 
positive possibly.  

Video 4: Predictions Regarding Cyberattacks 

So, different tech writers and different tech magazines have come with lot of predictions 
about  ransomware,  and  they  believe  that  the  ransomware  are  going  to  attack  more 
cloud and it will remain a very significant threat. And one of the very interesting thing 
come  as  a  ransomware  as  a  service.  There was  a  very interesting  report actually  in 
National Public Radio, where they went in the dark web where all these things happen, 
and they figured out that for ransomware as a service is a very solid model. You have 
a  one  at  a  toll-free  number.  You  can  dial  this  toll-free  number  and  they  will  tell  you 
exactly how to start a ransomware attack. So, they basically help you in initiating an 
attack. And if you buy a premium service then they will not only help you in initiating the 
attack, once the attack has happened and you have controlled the data, they will help 
you  in  negotiating  the  ransom  amount  that  how  much  amount  you  are  talking.  And 
ransom amounts can be big, several million dollars. That's what is happening right now. 
So, they help you in negotiation as well and this is a whole industry, they are employees, 
they give you 24/7 surveys if you pay higher. Means this is amazing. And now question 
is that why not government agency able to catch them?  Because they are all running 
from the places where we cannot control. So, there lot of initiative has started, like there 
was a one movement called No More Ransom Collaboration. This was the development 
and release of anti-ransomware technology. So, can we get together  and create this 

 ISB CTO 

5  

 
   
  
  
anti ransomware technology so that they are using AI, machine learning. We use the 
better one to get together. 

But  lot  of  new  ransomware  are  moving  towards  ransom  worm.  Now  what  is 
ransomworm? Ransom worm is that they will actually travel on itself from one computer 
to other. That is very dangerous. Then they will log data from one, from anybody you 
are connected, their data will also be logged and so on. So, we will see that, you know, 
this is one of the big challenges that we need to save right now. And cybercrime mostly 
happens from this rogue nations where you cannot go and catch them, or they will not 
listen to anybody, and this nation state will finance themselves by stealing money. Lot 
of fileless malware is also increasing. 

What is fileless malware? So, the traditional malware or viruses used to be that they 
will be a file which will go to your hardware, and they will run in your hardware. But this 
fileless one, they do not have any file, they just become part of your memory. So, very 
difficult to even catch for any virus scanner and so on. So, that is another problem that 
will  happen.  This  machine  learning  is  also  created  lot  of  social  engineering  attacks. 
What  is the  social  engineering attack? Social engineering  attack  is  like  somebody  is 
called and told, I am calling from your bank, and you need to give me your password 
because  there  is something  wrong  with  your account. Somebody has  stolen  all  your 
money.  That  is  a  typical  social  engineering,  or  they  are  generated  using  machine 
learning, so they look very real.  

That is another kind of attack happening right now. And these are all happening, means 
these are the pretty new attacks happening. Drone jacking is another one which is the 
big  threat.  Drone  jacking  or  jacking  your  autonomous  vehicles,  that  is  becoming  a 
problem. There are lot of drones now, and what if people start controlling? Drones can 
be controlled, right?  When drones are controlled by somebody, so hackers can also 
control it. And lot of rise of voice activated AI to access web data, that also leaves the 
door  open  for  attackers.  So,  if  you  have  because  we  are  using  face  one  voice  one, 
sometimes it is easier, and in fact it has been shown with generative AI and all that the 
voices can be fooled, and that is a gold mine for hackers because then they can  do 
wonders  there.  And  lot  of  these  pieces  are  happening  because  of  IoT,  Internet  of 
Things, and Industry 5.0. So, even though IoT and Industry 5.0 is a great thing, they 
have led to lot of increase attacks. 

And  another  kind  of  attack  rather  than  ransomware  happens.  Distributed  Denial  of 
Service  attack  which  means  that  you  are  getting  attacked  from  many  different 
computers  and  your  system  gets  so  cluttered  that  you  cannot  you  do  your  regular 
business. That is a distributed denial of service attack. But all of this IoT, they leave the 
door open for them. Interestingly, in last few years, lot of ransomware attacks happens 
on  logistic  companies.  Because  of  industry  5.0,  this  logistic  companies  are  getting 
connected to their system and logistic companies they have to pay lot of money. Why? 
Because logistic companies, they are carrying items from other parties, sometimes their 
whole path and all is decided in the system. If it is log, they don't know where to go. 
They also do not want to hurt their customers. They don't want bad reputation. So, what 
they do, they go ahead and pay the money and all this cyber security battles across 

 ISB CTO 

6  

 
   
  
  
countries  and  so  on.  They  are  favouring  criminals  because  they  can  do  lot  of  stuff 
because the rules are not there. So, Internet of Things is getting attacked by bot net of 
things, where the hackers are doing attacks through bots. Some of the targets in recent 
past and also expected to go in the future will be healthcare organisations. Because 
healthcare organisations even though their data is supposed to be very secured, it is 
not their core business. The IT is not their core business, and more healthcare data is 
being  digitised,  being  shared  so  that  they  become  the  nice  target  and  they  will  pay 
money  because  their  operation  rooms  are  logged,  they  can  do  surgeries.  You  know 
they are going to pay lot of money. 

Religious institutions, a lot of religious institutions in Western countries are now being 
attacked because they don't have very good security system. Another one is industrial 
control system, that is what is the hackers are now looking at because lot of these ones 
like, you know, industrial control system will be that you have a machine which is an 
IoT, but they do not have proper security. So, you know, some of the high-profile attacks 
in 2021 was Colonial Pipeline because they could not supply all the gas and oil because 
you know they were hacked, and lot of customers did not have supplies, so they paid 
4.4 million ransom payment. The FBI was able to trace the money by looking at all this 
and most of the money is paid not most, almost all of them is paid in crypto currencies. 
That is how they ask money. So, the FBI was able to trace the money by monitoring the 
cryptocurrency movement and digital wallets. But finding the actual hackers was very 
hard. They could not do it. 

Another  very  famous  case  was  Brenntag.  They  are  chemical  distribution  company. 
They  also  ended  up  paying  $4.4  million.  So,  we  are  talking  lot  of  money.  But  Acer 
computer company, they paid $50 million, and these are some of the high-profile attacks 
in 2021. But you know this is increasing. Lot of these companies are still being attacked. 
In January of 2023, FBI claimed that they have hacked the hackers to shut down their 
major  ransomware  group.  FBI  went  backdoor  so  they  went  into  dark  web  in  an 
undercover way. So, they did undercover operation, and they essentially hacked the 
hackers.  They  set  down  their  major  ransomware  group.  Some  of  this  which  I  talked 
about was what this ransomware as a service groups which are providing the service;  
and because of that, FBI claims that it will reduce. We will see how it goes on there. But 
this is this was certainly a big event.  

Video 5: CIA Triad in Information Security 

Now, when we think about cyber security side, there is something called CIA. The CIA 
of  Information  Security  talk  about  confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability.  Now,  the 
availability part is being attacked in ransomware. Because the data is not available to 
the users. But confidentiality and integrity are also important because the data has been 
compromised.  So,  the  CIA  triad  provides  for  this  security  objectives.  They  are  also 
called AIC triad because availability, integrity and confidentiality. And the goal is that 
we should make all the effort to accomplishing a compromise more costly in time and 
effort than it is worth to a potential attacker. So, can I make my system so hard to hack 
that for the hackers, what they gain by hacking is less than the cost they have to put in 
hacking.  

 ISB CTO 

7  

 
   
  
  
So, how can  you  create  that  kind of  system?  That  has been  the goal of  the modern 
cybersecurity  system  and  lot  of  these  things  are  traditional  but  modified.  One  is  the 
access control. Access controls talk about who can access what and when. That is a 
one  way  to  control  cybersecurity  and  goal  has  been  protect  all  the  objects  from 
unauthorised access, any modification, any disclosure for information and this access 
control should support the CIA triad so that you make it so hard for the hackers so that 
their cost is more than the gain they get. And here in the access control lot of things we 
do is role-based access control. So, here users have a set of control to determine who 
which objects can interact with that. Using the role-based access control, you define 
different access to different roles. 

So, first everybody is put in certain roles and these users can do these roles. And this 
can be done with all the operating system and software. These are not difficult to do. 
They  are  different  components  of  access  control.  You  have  to  have  identification  so 
every user to have to first identify them. That's where we see these days, you know, the 
duo and all which is part of authentication. So, I identify myself but how do I authenticate 
I am who I say I am. So, they say that you threw the two-layer security now and it is 
almost becoming a norm now to go to the two-layer security because of all the advent 
of industry 5.0 IoT and all the new cyberattacks coming and so you have to authenticate 
either through captcha or you have to find some animals, or you have to find where is 
the bridge and so on or two-layer security.  

And  then  authorisation.  Now,  am  I  allowed  to  what  am  I  allowed  to  access?  Once  I 
identify  and  authenticate  myself,  what  am  I  allowed  to  access  really?  What  are  my 
checks and rights and privileges and then it also tracked. Whatever you are doing is 
being tracked so that if you did something wrong or you are not supposed to do then 
there  will  be  repercussions  of  that.  And  in  the  authentication,  password  is  the  most 
commonly  used    but  lot  of  things  are  moving  to  biometrics  and  smart  card.  So, 
biometrics you know password within password. Now a lot of systems are using one-
time  password.  They send  you  a  code  which  you  can  use  it  for the  system  which  is 
changed to send through your text or email something you are which is biometrics. Lot 
of  this  biometric  authentication  system  is  fingerprint  face  thing  and  so  on  and  their 
accuracy  is  quite  large.  So,  last  time  when  I  was  coming  from  JFK  airport  in  fact 
interestingly while entering the gate final gate they were just doing facial thing.  

Now in India, we have similar thing using this Aadhar card if you link but you have to do 
some  linking.  This  also  happens  in  the  initial  security  here  landing,  boarding  the 
international  plane  and  no  initial  setting  you  don't  have  to  do  anything.  So,  they 
somehow had a picture which they think was good enough to match with how you are 
walking. Very interesting. But many such systems are coming in authentication. It can 
be  fingerprint,  palm  scan,  hand  geometry,  retina  wise  print,  facial  scan,  hand 
topography and so on. Something you have like a smart card. So, smart card is usually 
much more secure than memory card. It can include a microprocessor IC. So, you have 
to have that the card can have the card itself and some kind of authentication on top of 
it. It can be contact or contact less and lot of standards are being developed on that.  

 ISB CTO

And once all of this authentication is done, we also use cryptographic system. So, when 
data is going from one place to one other place it is encrypted so that if somebody even 
hacked they cannot decrypt it. And that is also used in systems like blockchain. They 
use  all  this  cryptography.  Another  piece  that  comes  in  and  protecting  the  system  is 
firewalls. So, you create these firewalls where you don't allow everybody, but whenever 
there are firewalls it adds lot of extra overhead for the users.  

Video 6: Cyberlaws in India Vs Other Countries 

So, when we look at the cyber law in India versus US, UK, all these countries, they all 
have been very different in this. Now US, like any other system, they have focused more 
on making sure that cyber attackers cannot come, and we are able to trace them and 
make it hard for them, but very case basis. In the UK, they have been lot more strict on 
that. Their rules are lot more strict, defined and these all are being revised right now 
and they have lot of criminal acts which is basically being rewritten almost, you know, 
as soon as they can do. In India, it has been little bit unclear. Lot of rules are either very 
old, or written very ambiguous manner and that is causing a problem.  

So,  there  have  been  lot  of push  in  fact both  US  and  UK had been  pushing  India on 
tightening their or modifying their cyber law because this is a global world, the data is 
moving from one place to the other, everything is connected. So, the most recent push 
right now is going on is that how we can create this AI based systems to combat cyber 
security because those attacks are also coming from AI based system. So, it is a race 
right now, how we can create better system. But with block chains and, combining that 
with generative AI, I think we have very good hope.  

Push for common digital rules at least for US, UK and India, there is a big push on that 
can we come on the common ground  so that it helps everybody. But you know all of 
these rules will work when we all you know agree on the terms. But I think there is a 
good hope that we can go there and that will be very good for the community and the 
growth of all these countries. But let me just you know reemphasise that we need to 
really understand and know how these emerging technologies are changing businesses 
and then keep relearning them. Because whatever we know today may get old but if we 
know  what  is  going  on  right  now  is  very  easy  for  us  to  relearn.  But  all  business 
executives need to have that focus, that mindset that how can I look at this technology 
about what business problems they can serve. Not just as a technology where all it can 
help me both in short run and the long run and keep reevaluating them because these 
technologies are going to impact all the existing businesses. They have a potential to 
create new businesses as well as disrupt the current businesses. So, if businesses don't 
want to get disrupted or they want to create new businesses, they need to learn about 
it. And solving problem is a one thing but the bigger thing is that how to ask questions 
and how to identify problems and then the technology's understanding will help you in 
getting  there.  So,  how  can  one  create  new  businesses  or  disrupt  in  industry  using 
emerging technology should be an ongoing debate and ongoing discussions. And if you 
can raise questions you can answer them. So, keep raising questions using everything 
we are seeing around us.
