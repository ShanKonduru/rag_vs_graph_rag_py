Week 10: Cybersecurity, Cyber and Tech Laws 

Video 1: Technology Laws in India 

• 

Industry 5.0 connects components through sensors, improving processes and data 
optimisation. 

•  Challenges arise, including data leakage and cyber threats, as all data becomes 

interconnected. 

•  Cross-border data transmission necessitates cybersecurity and legal regulations for Industry 

5.0. 

•  The Digital India Act in 2023 aims to replace the IT Act of 2000, covering emerging 

technologies and emphasising freedom of expression. 
It addresses online safety, AI, deepfake, data protection, and reevaluates safe harbour laws. 

• 
•  The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill focuses on data privacy and applies to data collected 

in India, even if it travels outside. 

•  Data fiduciaries must maintain data accuracy and security. 
•  These changes impact data ownership, user rights, and the IT industry, especially in the 

context of social media and generative AI. 

Video 2: Technology Laws in Other Developed Countries 

•  GDPR in the European Union is one of the strictest data protection laws globally. 
•  The U.S. relies on sector-specific regulations, resulting in variations in data protection. 
•  China enforces data localisation, causing challenges for international companies like Tesla. 
•  Balancing data protection and global collaboration is a complex issue. 
•  Clarity in legislation is essential to navigate the data privacy landscape effectively. 

Video 3: Cyberattacks: Trends 

•  Cyberattacks have become more random and automated, targeting smaller businesses with 

weaker security measures. 

•  Ransomware attacks have surged, with hackers demanding ransoms for locked data access. 
•  Diverse motivations, including malevolence, have driven the growth of cyberattacks. 
•  Cyber warfare poses a significant threat, and AI is used both in defence and in attack 

methods. 

•  The evolving digital landscape demands ongoing adaptation and security measures to 

address the changing nature of cyber threats. 

Video 4: Predictions Regarding Cyberattacks 

• 

"Ransomware as a Service" is a disturbing trend, providing tools and services for initiating 
ransomware attacks. 

•  Law enforcement agencies face challenges in pursuing cybercriminals operating from beyond 

their jurisdiction. 

•  Ransomware attacks are evolving into "ransom worms," capable of autonomously spreading 

• 

to other systems. 
"Fileless malware" resides in computer memory, making it difficult to detect with traditional 
antivirus solutions. 

•  AI-enhanced social engineering attacks are on the rise, increasing the sophistication of cyber 

threats. 

•  Emerging technologies like drones, autonomous vehicles, and voice-activated AI are 

becoming targets for cyberattacks.

•  The growth of IoT and Industry 5.0 has increased the vulnerability to cyber threats, including 

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. 

•  Potential targets for cyberattacks include healthcare organisations, religious institutions, and 

industrial control systems. 

•  High-profile ransomware attacks in 2021 led to significant ransom payments. 
• 

In 2023, the FBI claimed success in infiltrating and shutting down a major ransomware group, 
providing hope in the battle against cyber threats. 

Video 5: CIA Triad in Information Security 

•  The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) forms the basis for cybersecurity 

principles. 
In the context of ransomware attacks, availability is a critical aspect of the AIC Triad. 

• 
•  The goal of modern cybersecurity is to make hacking attempts more costly and challenging 

for attackers. 

•  Role-based Access Control is a fundamental component in access control, assigning different 

permissions based on roles. 

•  Access control involves identification, authentication, authorisation, and tracking of user 

actions. 

•  Authentication methods have evolved to include biometrics and two-factor authentication. 
•  Cryptographic systems are used to encrypt data during transmission, ensuring data 

protection. 

•  Firewalls act as protective barriers but may introduce additional user overhead in some 

cases. 

•  Balancing robust security measures with user-friendliness remains a challenge in the realm of 

cybersecurity. 

Video 6: Cyberlaws in India Vs Other Countries 

•  Cyber laws vary significantly between countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, 

and India. 

•  The U.S. focuses on deterring cyberattacks with a flexible, case-by-case approach. 
•  The UK maintains stringent and well-defined cyber laws that are continuously updated. 
• 
•  The global community is increasingly looking to AI-based systems to combat evolving cyber 

India faces challenges due to ambiguity and outdated rules in its cyber law. 

threats. 

•  Combining blockchain and generative AI offers potential solutions. 
•  Efforts to establish common digital rules are underway among key nations. 
•  Businesses must adapt to emerging technologies and foster a problem-solving mindset to 

stay competitive and relevant in an ever-changing landscape.
