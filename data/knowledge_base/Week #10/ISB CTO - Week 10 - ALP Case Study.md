ISB CTO: Cybersecurity

Action Learning Project

Learning Outcomes

breach, including the role of third-party vendors.

• Analyse the similarities and differences between the breaches at Target, 

AirAsia and T-Mobile, identifying common vulnerabilities and attack 
patterns.

• Evaluate the effectiveness of the responses taken by Target, Air Asia India, 

and T-Mobile, and identify areas for improvement.

cyber threats.

Introduction

• The Target data breach was a massive cyberattack that compromised the 

personal and financial information of millions of customers who shopped at 
Target stores between November 27 and December 15, 2013. 

• The breach occurred when hackers infiltrated Target’s network through a third-
party vendor and installed malware on the point-of-sale systems, allowing them 
to steal 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million customer 
records.

• The incident was one of the most high-profile data breaches of its kind, 

impacting customers across the country and costing Target billions of dollars in 
damages, lawsuits, and reputation loss. 

• The Target data breach also exposed the vulnerabilities of the U.S. payment card 
industry and prompted widespread changes in security standards and practices.

Highlights

• Nearly 40 million customers affected.

• Exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of up to 70 

million customers.

• Financial impact: Target reported losses of over $61 million.

• Over 80 lawsuits filed against Target.

The Target Breach

How the breach occurred

How it could have been 
prevented

• Attackers' methods, including 

reconnaissance.

• Compromise of a third-party 
vendor, Fazio Mechanical.

• Malware distribution, including 
the use of a custom "BlackPOS" 
malware.

• Access points exploited.

• Addressing all vulnerabilities, 

not just PCI compliance.
• Tokenization and its role in 
securing customer data.
• Investing in cybersecurity 

measures and maintaining an 
effective incident response 
plan.

• Considering third-party 

security

breach? What were the strengths and weaknesses of their communication 
strategy with the customers, the media, and the regulators?

• What were the short-term and long-term impacts of the breach on Target’s 
business performance, reputation, and customer loyalty? How did Target 
recover from the breach and regain trust from the stakeholders?
