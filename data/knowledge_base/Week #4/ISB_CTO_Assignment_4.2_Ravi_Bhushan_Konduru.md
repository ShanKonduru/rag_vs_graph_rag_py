Introduction to Digital Business Models 

In today's digital landscape, a digital business model outlines 
how  an  organization  creates,  delivers,  and  captures  value  through 
digital technologies.  

For Vedic Metaverses, this means leveraging technology not just 
for  its  core  mission  of  preserving  and  promoting  ancient  temple 
architecture,  but  also  for  how  technology 
interacts  with  our 
stakeholders and ensure long-term business sustainability.  

Let me attempt to give a brief overview of these models tailored to the 
needs of Vedic Metaverses: 

Assessment of Vedic Metaverses 

•  Omnichannel: This model focuses on providing a seamless and 
integrated  experience  across  all  interaction  points.  For  Vedic 
Metaverses,  this  could  mean  consistent  brand  experience 
whether  a  user  is  on  our  website  or  on  our  Mobile  app  or 
physically present in our merchandise outlet. The content and 
branding would be cohesive across these touchpoints. 

•  Personalization  and  Subscription  Services:  Personalization 
involves  tailoring  digital  experiences  based  on  individual  user 
interests,  preferences  and  online 
interaction  analytics. 
Subscription  services  offer  exclusive  content,  features,  or 
access for a recurring fee, creating a direct revenue stream and 
fostering a deeper connection with supporters. 

•  Business as a Service (BaaS): At Vedic Metaverses, BaaS could 
potentially involve offering our unique digital modeling or data 
analysis capabilities to other non-profit organizations, research 
institutions,  or  even  cultural  heritage  agencies  on  a  service 
basis. 

•  Platform  Models:  The  Vedic  Metaverses  eco-system  of 
products and services could be used as a platform connecting 
researchers,  educators,  devotees,  and  technology  experts

Analysis of Business Model and Recommendation 

important 

•  Omnichannel:  While 

for  brand  consistency, 
omnichannel  is  more  of  a  strategy  than  a  primary  revenue 
model. It supports the overall user experience across different 
digital and physical interactions. 

•  Personalization  and  Subscription  Services:  This  aligns 
strongly  with  Vedic  Metaverses'  goals.  Personalization 
enhances  user  engagement  and  learning,  while  subscription 
services can provide a recurring revenue stream to support our 
mission and ongoing work. 

•  Business as a Service (BaaS): This could be a viable option in 
the  long  term,  leveraging  our  specialized  digital  skills  and 
resources.  However,  it  might  require  a  more  mature  stage  of 
development  and  a  clear  understanding  of  potential  market 
needs within the cultural heritage sector. 

•  Platform Models: This model directly supports our mission of 
connecting  stakeholders,  democratizing  knowledge,  and 
facilitating  collaboration.  It  provides  a  central  hub  for  all  our 
digital assets and community interactions.

personalisation  and  subscription  services  and  platform  model 
would be most appropriate and it is strategically aligned with Vedic 
Metaverses. Mission. 

However,  to  be  even  more  precise,  I  recommend  a  model  that 
strongly emphasizes cultural heritage engagement through: 

•  Platform  Model:  Serves  as  the  primary  access  point  for  all 

digital resources and community interactions. 

•  Personalisation  &  Subscription  services:  Offering  a  broad 
range  of  valuable  content  based  on  type  of  subscription 
models.  These  subscription  models  are  tailored  to  individual 
interests,  to  attract  a  wide  audience  and  fulfill  the  mission  of 
democratizing knowledge.

assets.

dedicated membership base can also be more attractive 
to  grant-making  organizations  and  corporate  sponsors
