Week 4: CTO as Innovation Catalyst: Managing Innovation Portfolio 

Video 1: Module Overview 

In the previous module, we focused upon the role of the Chief Technology Officer as an 
innovation  catalyst, and  we  identified  three  different  ways of  digital  innovation  sweet 
spots  within  the  existing  business  model.  We  talked  about  enriching  the  customer 
interface, synchronising core operations and creating digital products and services.  

In this module, we will continue to add some more ideas and knowledge about the role 
of  the  CTO  as  an  innovation  catalyst.  We  will  talk  about  two  additional  ideas.  First, 
rather than enhancing the existing business model, are there opportunities for creating 
a new business model, creating a digital business model or innovating a digital business 
model? So, we will focus upon that. And then, as an innovation catalyst, there are likely 
to be a stream or a portfolio of innovation projects. Are there ways in which the CTO 
can keep a portfolio perspective in order to make sure that there is a balance among 
the stream of ideas in the organisation?  

So, in this module, we will first talk about how do you engage in digital business model 
innovation? Are there different types of digital business models? And then second, how 
do you manage a digital innovation portfolio? 

Video 2: Approaches to Digital Business Model Innovation: Overview 

In thinking about digital business model innovation, it is first useful to think about, are 
there some underlying principles which create a motivation? Or in other words, why do 
digital business model innovation? And we can identify three reasons for that.  

First, is to enhance the customer delight and experience. Second, is to synchronise and 
harmonise the core operations. Now, you will recognise that these were two specific 
ideas we had already discussed. But here the difference is, what if you want to do both? 
It is not just sufficient to enrich the customer experience, but you also have to marry 
that with synchronising and streamlining the core operations. In other words, create a 
new way of performing core operations and a new way of delighting the customer. And 
the third,  do  that by orchestrating new ecosystems.  So,  you  can  see,  this is a much 
more complex way of thinking, that's why we need to think about a new business model.  

So,  are  there  specific business models that we  can  identify  as  approaches  to  digital 
business  model  innovation?  We  will  focus  on  four  such  models.  First  one,  is 
omnichannel.  We  will  talk  about  a  subscription-based  model.  We  will  talk  about 
business as a service, and then we will talk about a platform business model. 

Video 3: Omnichannel Digital Business Model 

So, what is an omnichannel digital business model?  

The word omni suggests all, and the word omnichannel suggests multiple channels, all 
connected to deliver a seamless experience. Traditionally, firms relied on the brick-and-

 ISB CTO 

1  

 
   
  
  
mortar,  either  their  store  or  their  branch  office.  In  an  omnichannel,  the  focus  is  on 
providing  customers  access  to  products,  services  and  other  offerings  seamlessly, 
across multiple digital, physical and other channels.  

Think about the world available to a customer today. And that world includes apps on 
their phone, it includes web, it includes the brick-and-mortar stores, it includes a call 
centre, it includes fax and even includes a salesperson. How do you blend all of these 
channels seamlessly to put the customer at the centre of that experience and let the 
customer choose how he or she wants to conduct business? It is also about providing 
customer with  support  for different  stages of  their  journey, and  the  ability  to  execute 
their  wishes  across  those  channels,  and  for  the  firm  to  support  that  in  a  seamless 
manner. What are some examples?  

Starbucks  is  legendary  for  their  omnichannel  digital  business  model.  Customers  of 
Starbucks can go into their store and smell the coffee proverbially, literally and buy their 
coffee. Customers can use their app to place the order while in the store or when they 
are  approaching  the  store.  Or  they  can  use  the  app  to  identify  the  nearest  location, 
place the order and be ready to have it picked up. The app also uses total rewards. So, 
the customers can choose their points to either redeem or to build. So, in other words, 
a seamless blending of the app, the web and the store is an example of omnichannel 
in action at Starbucks. Why would you choose this business model? The primary goal 
is delighting the customer by owning the customer relationship end-to-end. What is an 
important  metric  of  success?  Net  promoter score,  in  other  words,  how  many  people 
recommend you. That is a very simple, but very powerful metric.  

From a CTO perspective, what are the strategic levers to execute or build this business 
model? First, business process integration, integrating the various business processes 
seamlessly across channels. A lot of emphasis on automation, technology such as rapid 
process automation, building on top of ERP systems. Second important strategic lever 
is data warehousing and analytics because itâ€™s got to be smart. You have to be able to 
recognise  your  customer  instantly  and  marry  that  with  mobility  technology.  The  third 
strategic lever is social media, mobility and cloud.  

So, you can see, how a CTO can translate the vision of an omnichannel business model 
by identifying specific technology priorities. In this case, once again, business process 
integration and automation, data warehousing and analytics, smart mobility and cloud 
platforms. 

Video 4: Personalisation and Subscription Services 

Personalisation and subscription services is another emerging digital business model. 
What does this mean?  

Think  about  Netflix and  what  did  Netflix  do. Rather than  offering their  customers the 
ability to rent specific movies, Netflix introduced a subscription model, which is the flat 
monthly  fee,  and  in  return  for  that  make  available  a  whole  range  of  entertainment 
offerings. So, customers can choose any movie, any video, and they can consume them 
all that you want.  

 ISB CTO 

2  

 
   
  
  
So, underlying the subscription model is a flat fee and consume all that you want. Once 
again, it puts the customer in the driver seat because they don't need to price individual 
products. Remember, we said reimagine your business around your customer. So, the 
subscription model is an example of that.  

In  the  automobile  industry,  companies  such  as  Audi  and  BMW  are  beginning  to 
experiment with this digital business model. Think about the traditional model for Audi, 
which is their customers buy a car or lease a car, btu the minimum lease duration is 
three years, which means that, whatever they buy, they've got to use it for three years. 
What if the customers were charged or were willing to pay a monthly subscription fee 
and they could literally choose a car each day? They are going on a family  vacation; 
they might want to van. If they are just going as a couple, they might want to rent a 
sports car. The idea is to provide access to the whole product portfolio without lock in 
effects. 

And the advantage of a subscription model is that it tends to attract customers with a 
higher willingness to pay, and as a result, it tends to be more profitable. So, this is a 
model where  the  goal is to  delight  the  customer by  offering  them access  to  a  broad 
product variety and enabling them to personalise the choice of the product almost on a 
real time, almost on a daily basis.  

What's the metric for measuring the success of this model? The metric is share of the 
customer's  wallet,  meaning  that  customers  need  cars,  but  a  subscription  model 
changes the equation for them because they don't have to choose. They don't have to 
spend  a  lot of time  committing  to one  car,  because  now they  can be  flexible  in  their 
choice  and  they  can  access  any  car  depending  upon  the  day,  their  mood  and  their 
situation.  

What  are  the  strategic levers to  make  this happen?  First,  broad  product  variety.  So, 
from a business model perspective, the firm has to commit itself to frequent refresh of 
its products, expanding the product variety. Think about Netflix. Netflix keeps adding 
more and more content, otherwise the choices could go stale. Audi would have to keep 
adding more features, more different types of cars, otherwise the choices could go stale. 
So, product  innovation,  refresh  and product variety  is a  fundamental requirement for 
the success of this model. Second, from a technology perspective, deep personalisation 
the  customers  make  choices,  build 
through  data  and  analytics.  helping 
recommendation engines, using collaborative filtering as an analytics technique to help 
customers discover what others like them have chosen, and expanding the range of 
choices  available  to  them.  And  third,  business  process  integration  and  automation. 
Once again, a technology such as rapid process automation. 

Video 5: Business as a Service 

A third opportunity for business model innovation, digital business model innovation, is 
referred to as Business as a Service. What's unique here?  

This is an emerging digital business model that shifts the customer supplier relationship 
from a traditional model of ownership to a model that evolves around providing services 
on a non-ownership basis. Good example is Uber. Uber is an example of a Business 

 ISB CTO 

3  

 
   
  
  
as a Service because what do you care about? You care about mobility, but you can 
now get there without owning a car, Business as a Service.  

Airbnb Business as a Service, you don't need to go to a hotel property. Increasingly, we 
are seeing the emergence of many different sharing models, all under the classification 
of Business as a Service. Rent clothes, clothes as a service. So, this is a service centred 
model where the customers are the focal point.  

Once  again,  reimagine  the  business  around  the  customer.  Think  about  their 
complementary  consumption  needs.  Organisations  not  only  supply  the  product,  but 
they support and offer value in use.  

A  dramatic  example  of  that  is  the  pivot  made  by  GE  engines.  If  you  think  about  GE 
engines, they manufacture and sell engines to aircraft. Their relationship with Airlines 
traditionally  was one about,  we  design  engines,  we  sell them  to  you,  you own  those 
engines, we help train you in your maintenance, but after that. you are responsible for 
the uptime and availability.  

GE launched a Business as a Service called GE Predix. And the whole idea was, you 
don't buy engines. You rent engines from us. We still own the engines. When they are 
outfitted on your aircraft, we take the responsibility for predictive maintenance, and we 
guarantee you up availability of miles in the air. In other words, you as an airline no 
longer have to devote your precious capital to buying engines and maintaining them. 
You just procure availability as a service, and we take care of the business. That builds 
a deep intimate relationship. It has a higher willingness to pay, and that's a model once 
again of a manufacturing company pivoting to Business as a Service.  

What's the metric? Here, the metric again is share of the customer's wallet. If an airline 
can  buy  engines  from  different  companies,  would  they  prefer  the  flexibility  and  the 
convenience of GE Predix? And that's the reason why it's an attractive model.  

So,  what  are  the  advantages  of  Business  as  a  Service?  It  is  ecologically  and 
environmentally a more sustainable solution, because not everybody has to invest in 
maintenance  facilities.  There  could  be  a  single  maintenance  facility.  So,  at  the  time 
when there is consciousness about the planet and the environment, this is a sustainable 
solution.  This model does  not  require  the  customers to  make  upfront  investments. It 
allows them to pay only what they consume, so that the premium products are available 
to a larger number of customers. It shifts fixed costs to variable costs, and enables firms 
to pay as they go, and that's a huge attraction.  

For suppliers, it enables predictable renewable revenue streams. Another advantage is 
that organisations can have access to a wider pool of potential customers, especially 
the small and medium enterprises, which might not be so comfortable with large upfront 
investments. So, it leads suppliers to generate more revenue.  

Another advantage is that since the customers are serviced at every step in the use of 
the product,  constant contact  is required between  the firm  and  its suppliers. So, this 
provides the supplier with valuable data about the customer and about the product and 
becomes a valuable source of product innovation and R&D. And final advantage is that 

 ISB CTO 

4  

 
   
  
  
this is an opportunity to increase customer loyalty since it creates a huge dependency 
between  the  customer  and  the  supplier.  So,  what  are  the  strategic  levers  for 
implementing  this  model?  CTOs  must  recognise  a  big  shift  here  toward  services-
oriented  architecture,  where  the  focus  is  not  about  technology  alone,  it's  not  about 
applications alone, but it's around defining services. And services are a combination of 
data,  application,  technology,  bundling  them  into  units.  Rapid  process  automation, 
another important strategic lever. And the third one is, data warehousing and analytics 

Video 6: Platform Model 

The platform model is a fourth alternative approach to digital business model innovation. 
And  this  is  fundamentally  a  revolutionary  model.  The  other  three  are  what  we  call 
evolutionary  models.  The  platform  model  is  a  very  new  and  a  novel  way  of  building 
business models. Let's try to understand this. Let's consider an example that most of 
you are familiar with, and that example is Uber. Ask yourself, what business does Uber 
do?  

And  the  answer  is,  Uber  provides  mobility  services.  Ask  yourself,  who  are  Uber's 
customers?  And  you  might  say,  it's  the  people  who  need  a  ride,  in  other  words, 
passengers.  So,  Uber  provides  convenient,  flexible,  predictable,  anywhere,  anytime 
access to mobility for passengers. In other words, the value proposition is, traditionally 
if you needed a mobility solution, you depended upon taxis. So, you had to go find a 
taxi stand, you had to negotiate with the taxi driver. Sometimes, depending upon hour 
of the day, you're lucky if they would go where you wanted to go. So, a lot of friction 
points in that model. And Uber's value proposition was, "We have an app, and you just 
pick the ride, and the car comes to you." That's the value proposition.  

So, if you said passengers, those needing mobility, are Uber's customers, you would 
be right. But are they the only customers that Uber has? Ask yourself, who provides 
that ride? Are they Uber employees? And the answer would be no. These are people 
who own cars and are willing to provide their car as a service for the ride. So, the point 
of this is, it turns out that even the drivers are Uber's customers. Because Uber needs 
to entice them to their platform to be willing to drive for six to eight hours a day and to 
be willing to respond anytime there is a customer or a passenger who needs a ride.  

So, this is an interesting situation, where we usually don't have two types of customers. 
Usually, there is one customer and multiple segments, but this is somewhat different. 
We  have  riders  and  we  have  drivers.  Two  different  types  of  customers,  but  more 
importantly, they depend upon each other. You will see in the graphic that we call this 
dependency. Drivers need passengers. Passengers need drivers. So, Uber essentially 
is  in  the  business  of  connecting  drivers  and  passengers.  Every  time  there  is  a 
passenger who needs a ride, the Uber technology infrastructure creates awareness of 
the location of passenger and where they want to go and what's the fare. And the driver 
has that information, responds to that ride, and shows up.  

So, this is a platform model. In here, fundamentally, there are two customers. Uber is 
the platform, and the platform connects these two sets of customers. And every time it 
connects a driver and a passenger, there is a ride, and the ride is a transaction. And 

 ISB CTO 

5  

 
   
  
  
when the passenger pays for the ride, Uber collects a commission and passes on the 
rest of the payment to the driver. So, we call this a platform model. And there are many 
such  examples  of  platform  models  growing  today.  Airbnb,  again,  a  platform  model 
connecting property owners with those who want to rent a property for a stay. And the 
transaction is a stay. And again, same features as Uber. So, we're beginning to see the 
rise of a new business model in a platform model. And notice in here, Uber does not 
own cars. So, we say that the platform model is asset-light. Unlike a taxi or a hotel which 
owns the property or the car, this is asset-light.  

So, a platform model is connect and transact, leverage interactions between two sides 
that  depend  upon  each  other  around  a  unit  of  value.  Two  sides  are  drivers  and 
passengers,  unit  of  value  is  a  ride.  And  ride  creates  a  transaction  that  creates  a 
monetary payment. Uber collects a commission, and the driver collects the money, and 
the passenger gets a meaningful, fulfilling ride. So, what's the metric in the success of 
this?  The  metric  is  winner-take-all,  meaning  that,  market  share,  there  are  huge 
opportunities to gain market share. Is this model unique to Uber and Airbnb?  

Now, think about eBay, which is the world's largest auction site. eBay attracts people 
who have something to sell and people who want to buy, and it generates auctions. So, 
the eBay is an auction platform where, more buyers benefit if there are more sellers, 
and more sellers benefit if there are more buyers. So, once again, eBay connects and 
transacts, and the unit of value is an auction. And eBay's value proposition is, you can 
buy  anything  on  eBay  because  there  are  buyers  and  sellers.  So,  what  are  the 
advantages of a platform? Greater access to sellers, better value to consumers, ability 
to grow the market very rapidly. It is asset-light, so it's much more flexible. It can be 
scaled rapidly, and it creates greater opportunities for innovation.  

How  do  you  build  a  platform?  What  are  the  strategic  levers  of  a  platform?  Data 
warehouse and analytics, because if the unit is a ride or a unit of value, and if you will 
execute  thousands  of  such  units  every  day,  you  need,  uh,  reliable  data.  So,  data 
warehouse and analytics. Mobility and social media. Mobility is fundamental because 
that's how you create a ride or a stay or any unit of exchange. And app infrastructure is 
again very important in this context. Cloud is a key to the success of this model. And 
equally  importantly,  cybersecurity.  There  is  a  lot  of  sensitive  and private data on  the 
platform, so cybersecurity is a huge element of the success of this model.  

So,  as  you  think  about  platform  models,  they  are  growing  in  popularity.  And  ask 
yourself,  is  there  a  platform  in  your  business?  And  if  so,  what  kind  of  technology 
investments must you make order to facilitate that platform model? 

Video 7: Managing the Digital Innovation Portfolio 

Another important element of a Chief Technology Officer's role, skill and acumen as an 
innovation catalyst is how do you manage the digital innovation portfolio?  

The underlying challenge is there are many sources of ideas for digital innovation, there 
are  many  reasons  for  building  projects.  What's  the  common  thread?  How  can  you 
maintain oversight that you are listening to the right ideas? You're paying attention to 
opportunities for gathering ideas and then more importantly, still there is only so much 

 ISB CTO 

6  

 
   
  
  
money available in the organisation, are you investing them in the right way? So, let's 
talk about where do ideas come from? Essentially, digital innovation is open innovation. 
Ideas  come  from  both  inside  the  organisation  and  increasingly  from  outside  the 
organisation. Ideas come from people who are responsible for technology, information 
technology, people who are responsible for managing social, mobile, analytics, cloud, 
technology  infrastructures  in  your  organisation.  But  they  also  come  from  business 
users,  those  who  use  these  technologies  in  their  interactions  with  customers, 
employees and suppliers. They also come from vendors, your strategic partners who 
help you build the technology infrastructure.  

So, an important implication here is, are you mapping different sources of innovation 
ideas and periodically assessing how much are you listening to those different voices? 
Because fundamentally, the key idea here is, it's open innovation, not just a small group 
responsible for all the ideas But ideas come from anywhere, so managing the idea flow 
is  an  important  challenge  and  responsibility  of  the  Chief  Technology  Officer  as  an 
innovation catalyst.  

Video 8: Pathways of Digital Value 

Another key element of managing the digital innovation portfolio is, how do you assess 
the value of these individual innovation projects?  

After all, every project takes time, it costs money, it demands attention from people in 
the organisation. So, money, time, people's energy, these are valuable skills, these are 
valuable resources, and you've got to make sure that you're spending them wisely, that 
you're not creating a chaotic situation where you're chasing every innovation idea.  

So, one of the paradoxes is, on one hand, open innovation, keep yourself receptive and 
open to all innovation ideas, but at the same time, how do you manage the portfolio in 
such a way that you are allocating time, money and energy to the right projects? At any 
time, there are likely to be numerous demands for digital investments in a firm, so how 
can you categorise the investments? How can you identify the right way of justifying 
those investments?  

So,  I'm  going  to  offer  you  six  different  ways  of  thinking  about  the  digital  innovation 
portfolio. We call them the six rationales, meaning that, in your portfolio,  as you look at 
the projects and as you seek a balance, make sure that there are sufficient projects for 
each of these six different goals. The cost of each project might not be the same, so it's 
not about equal number of projects as much as making sure that you are covering all 
these six angles. So, what are they?  

Some  projects  might  be  necessary  because  they  are  mandatory,  meaning  that  the 
government might have introduced a new law for privacy of a data regulation. So, do 
you have a project, a technology project to take care of mandatory needs imposed by 
government  or  by  regulators?  Sometimes  these  projects  don't  take  a  whole  lot  of 
money, they also don't take a whole lot of time. But with the word mandatory, we mean 
there's no discussion, you've got to do it right now. So, an important characteristic of 
these projects is urgency. They have to be done right now, okay? So, time is not on 

 ISB CTO 

7  

 
   
  
  
your  side,  but  the  good  news  is,  they're  not  expensive  and  they  can  be  done  very 
quickly.  

There's  a  second  type  of  innovation  projects,  and  we  call  them  technology  renewal. 
Meaning that, you've invested in analytics software, but you need to upgrade it. Very 
often, you have some discretion, there's no sense of urgency, unlike mandatory. But if 
you postpone these investments, then there's a concept called technical debt. Meaning 
that, the more difficult it becomes to upgrade later. So, there's a cost of postponing, uh, 
these kind of upgrades. So, are you paying attention to where upgrades are needed 
and timing them? They're not expensive if done properly at the right time, but as the 
technical debt increases, these upgrades can become very expensive.  

There is a third area of innovation, incremental business process improvement. If you're 
a retailer and you want to improve the efficiency or the customer service in your stores, 
and  you  decide  that  there's  an  opportunity  to  use  iPads  to  build  a  better  form  of  a 
technology-based service model in the store. That's an incremental business process 
improvement, because the project itself will not be expensive, it will not take time, and 
the gains will be incremental. But they may be needed, because the more you postpone 
them, your competitors might build a better store experience. So, that's what we mean 
by incremental business process improvement.  

The  fourth  category  is  competitive  necessity.  This  is  where  your  competitor  has 
launched a new app for mobile payments or digital payments, and you need to respond. 
So,  just  like  mandatory  investments,  there's  a  sense  of  urgency.  Expenses  are  not 
large, but the more you postpone this, the more there's a threat of being beaten by your 
competitor.  

The fifth one is competitive advantage. This is where you look at your business model 
and  you  identify  the  digital  innovation  sweet  spots,  and  you  say  this  will  give  us  a 
competitive advantage. The scale of finances needed for such projects is larger, they 
take more time, and the urgency is not high. So, you don't have to rush, but on the other 
hand, they may take more time and money than the earlier categories of uh, projects.  

And the sixth one is we call it the digital infrastructure. Investing in data warehousing, 
investing in cloud, investing in mobility. These are large scale investments. They often 
take many months, sometimes a year or two, and the good news is you have time on 
your side. You don't need to do them immediately. The bad news is, these are complex, 
these are technically challenging and they're risky, but you cannot avoid them.  

So,  what's  the  implication  of  this  portfolio  approach  for  a  CTO  to  be  aware  of  the 
business priorities driving these, and how do you balance them? You can probably do 
maybe  at  most  one  digital  infrastructure  project.  You  can  do  several  mandatory 
technology renewal and business process improvement projects. But the key thing is to 
make sure you're not doing so many of the small things that you don't have any time for 
the large important things.  

Same way, you're so focused on the one year project that you have no space or time 
available for the smaller projects. So, paying attention to these six categories is how 
the CTO can be an effective innovation catalyst.

Video 9: Module Summary 

As we summarise the role of a Chief Technology Officer as an innovation catalyst, what 
are some key reflections?  

First, there are different digital innovation sweet spots available today. We talked about 
them as: enrich and enhance customer relationships, synchronise operations, launch 
digital  products  and  services,  innovate  new digital  business  models.  So,  think  about 
these, we talked about the examples, and ask yourself what does it take to execute any 
one  of  these  digital innovation  sweet  spots?  Second  important  reflection  is  ideas  for 
digital  innovation  occur  anywhere  within  your  enterprise  and  even  outside  of  the 
enterprise. So, how are you going to nurture open innovation? Third, the motivation, or 
ideas  for  digital  innovation  occur  for  different  reasons.  We  talked  about  six  different 
reasons, so be aware of them and balance attention. CTOs as innovation catalysts must 
ensure that their organisation is capitalising on these ideas, opportunities, and sources.
