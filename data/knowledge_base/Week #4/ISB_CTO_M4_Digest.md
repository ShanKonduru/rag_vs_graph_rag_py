Week 4: CTO as Innovation Catalyst: Managing Innovation Portfolio 

While  discussing  the  role  of  the  Chief  Technology  Officer  (CTO)  as  an  innovation 
catalyst within an organisation, we explored three distinct avenues of digital innovation 
that  can  augment  the  existing  business  model:  enriching  the  customer  interface, 
synchronising core operations and creating digital products and services. Building upon 
this foundation, let us delve two additional concepts:  

•  Enhance the existing business model 

Are there opportunities for creating a new business model or innovating a digital 
business model? Are there different types of digital business models? 

•  Manage a digital innovation portfolio  

Are there ways in which the CTO can keep a portfolio perspective in order to 
make  sure  that  there  is  a  balance  among  the  stream  of  ideas  in  the 
organisation?  

Motivations for Digital Business Model Innovation 

When considering digital business model innovation, it is important to understand the 
underlying principles and motivations that drive organisations. By exploring the reasons 
behind digital business model innovation, we can better comprehend its value. Three 
key motivations can be identified:  

•  Enhancing customer delight and experience 
•  Synchronising and harmonising core operations  
•  Orchestrating new ecosystems 

Digital Business Model Innovation: Approaches 

There  are  specific  business  models  that  we  can  identify  as  approaches  to  digital 
business  model  innovation  and  we  will  focus  on  four  such  models:  omnichannel, 
subscription-based model, business as a service and platform business model. 

Omnichannel model 

The word omni suggests all, and the word omnichannel suggests multiple channels, all 
connected to deliver a seamless experience. Traditionally, firms relied on the brick-and-
mortar, either their store or their branch office.  

In an omnichannel, the focus is on providing customers access to products, services 
and  other  offerings  seamlessly,  across  multiple  digital,  physical  and  other  channels. 
Omnichannel digital business model is about  

•  Blending the different channels seamlessly to put the customer at the centre of 
that experience and let the customer choose how he or she wants to conduct 
business

ability to execute their wishes across those channels, and for the firm to support 
that in a seamless manner  

Primary Goal 
Delight the customer by owning the customer relationship end-to-end

•  Business process integration 

- 

Integrating the various business processes seamlessly across 
channels 

-  Emphasising on automation, technology such as rapid process 

automation, building on top of ERP systems 

•  Data warehousing and analytics  

-  Have the ability to recognise your customer instantly and marry 

that with mobility technology 
•  Social media, mobility and cloud 

Example: Starbucks 

•  Customers of Starbucks can go into their store and smell the coffee proverbially, 

literally and buy their coffee.  
•  Customers can use their app to  

o  Place the order while in the store or when they are approaching the store 
o 
Identify  the  nearest  location,  place  the  order  and  be  ready  to  have  it 
picked up 

o  Access the total rewards program through which customers can choose 

their points to either redeem or to build.  

Personalisation and Subscription Services Model 

This  business  model  reiterates  the  concept  of  reimagining  the  business  around  the 
customer. Underlying the subscription model is a flat fee and consume all that you want. 
It  puts  the  customer  in  the  driver  seat  because  they  don't  need  to  price  individual 
products. The advantage of a subscription model is that it tends to attract customers 
with a higher willingness to pay, and as a result, it tends to be more profitable 

Primary Goal 

Delight the customer by offering them access to a broad product variety and 
enabling them to personalise the product choice almost in real time, almost on 
a daily basis

•  Broad product variety 

-  Product innovation, frequent refresh of products and expanding 

product variety is a fundamental requirement for the success of this 
model 

•  Deep personalisation through data and analytics 

-  Help customers make choices,  
-  Build recommendation engines 
-  Use collaborative filtering as an analytics technique to help customers 

discover what others like them have chosen 
-  Expanding the range of choices available to them 

•  Business process integration and automation

Example: Netflix 

Rather than offering their customers the ability to rent specific movies, Netflix introduced 
a subscription model, though which it made available a whole range of entertainment 
offerings for a flat monthly fee.  

Business as a Service Model 

This is an emerging digital business model that shifts the customer supplier relationship 
from a traditional model of ownership to a model that evolves around providing services 
on a non-ownership basis.  

This is a service centred model where the customers are the focal point. Once again, 
reimagine  the  business  around  the  customer.  Think  about  their  complementary 
consumption needs. Organisations not only supply the product, but they support and 
offer value in use.

enabling them to personalise the product choice almost in real time, almost on 
a daily basis

•  Services-oriented architecture 

-  Focus on technology, applications and defining services which are a 

combination of data, application, technology, bundling them into units. 

•  Rapid process automation 
•  Data warehousing and analytics. 

Example: GE Engines 

GE  sold  engines  to  airlines  and  trained  them  in  maintenance.  The  airlines  were 
responsible for the uptime and availability. GE launched a Business as a Service called 
GE Predix through which the engines were rented to the airlines, but the ownership and 
maintenance remained GE’s responsibility.

Platform Model 

The  three  models  discussed  are  evolutionary  models  while  this  business  model  is  a 
revolutionary model. It centres around creating a digital platform that connects various 
participants,  such  as  customers,  suppliers  and  producers  to  facilitate  interactions, 
transactions  and  value  exchange.  Organisations  operating  as  platforms  can  capture 
value through network effects, data-driven insights and ecosystem growth.  

Primary Goal 

Connect and transact, leverage interactions between two sides that depend 
upon each other around a unit of value

•  Rapid process automation 
•  Data warehousing and analytics. 

Example: Uber 

Uber provides mobility services. It is a platform connects two sets of customers 

•  Riders who need convenient, flexible, predictable, anywhere, anytime mobility 
•  Drivers who are car owners willing to the mobility service  

Every time there is a passenger who needs a ride, the Uber technology infrastructure 
creates awareness of the location of passenger and where they want to go and what's 
the fare. And the driver has that information and responds to that ride and shows up. 
And every time it connects a driver and a passenger, there is a ride, and the ride is a 
transaction. And when the passenger pays for the ride, Uber collects a commission and 
passes on the rest of the payment to the driver.  

Advantages of Platform Model 

•  Greater access to sellers 
•  Better value to consumers  
•  Rapid market growth  
•  Asset-light, so it's much more flexible 
•  Rapid scalability 
•  Greater opportunities for innovation 

Managing the Digital Innovation Portfolio 

In addition to being an innovation catalyst, one crucial aspect of a Chief Technology 
Officer's  (CTO)  role  lies  in  effectively  managing  the  digital  innovation  portfolio.  This 
entails  addressing  the  underlying  challenge  of  numerous  sources  of  ideas  for  digital 
innovation, each with distinct reasons for project development. Therefore, it becomes 
imperative to identify the common thread that connects these ideas and ensure that the 
right  ideas  are  given  due  attention  and  consideration.  Moreover,  since  financial 
resources  are  limited  within  an  organisation,  it  is  crucial  to  invest  them  wisely.  This

article delves into the origins of these ideas and explores the significance of mapping 
various sources of innovation. 

Sources of Innovation Ideas 

Digital innovation, by its nature, thrives on open innovation. Ideas originate from both 
internal  and  external  sources, 
for  potential 
breakthroughs.  

thereby  broadening 

the  scope 

• 

Ideas  emerge  from  technology-focused  individuals  responsible  for  managing 
information  technology  infrastructures  encompassing  social,  mobile,  analytics, 
and cloud technologies within the organisation.  

•  Business users, who directly engage with customers, employees and suppliers, 

also contribute valuable insights.  

•  Vendors  and  strategic  partners  who  assist  in  building  the  organisation's 
technology infrastructure are another significant source of innovative ideas.  

So, an important implication here is to map different sources of innovation ideas and 
assess periodically how much you are listening to those different voices. Managing the 
idea  flow  is  an  important  challenge  and  responsibility  of  the  CTO  as  an  innovation 
catalyst. 

Assessment of Value of Individual Innovation Projects 

Every  project  takes  time,  costs  money  and  demands  attention  from  people  in  the 
organisation and these valuable skills and resources must be spent wisely.  

So, while CTOs have to be receptive and open to all innovation ideas, they also have 
to manage the portfolio in such a way that time, money and energy is allocated to the 
right projects. To categorise the investments and identify the right way to justify those 
investments there are six different ways of thinking about the digital innovation portfolio: 

Mandatory 

Technology 
Renewal 

Incremental 
Process 
Improvement 

Competitive 
Necessity 

Competitive 
Advantage 

Digital 
Infrastructure 

Incremental gains 

•  Driven by government or regulator 
•  Less expensive 
•  Calls for immediate action 
•  Driven by periodic software updates 
•  Less expensive if timed correctly 
•  Non-urgent carries postponement cost 
•  Driven by a need to deliver improved customer experience 
•  Less expensive and less time-consuming 
• 
•  Driven by market competition 
•  Less expensive but delays can be costly 
•  Calls for immediate action 
•  Driven by need to stay ahead of competition 
•  Calls for high investment 
•  Time-consuming but not urgent 
•  Driven by future business opportunities 
•  Calls for large scale investments 
•  Time consuming but not urgent 
•  Complex but unavoidable

Key Reflections 

•  There are different digital innovation sweet spots available today, 

o  Enrich and enhance customer relationships 
o  Synchronise operations 
o  Launch digital products and services 
o 
Innovate new digital business models 

•  What does it take to execute any one of these digital innovation sweet spots?  
• 

Ideas for digital innovation occur anywhere within enterprise and outside of the 
enterprise. So, how to nurture open innovation?  

•  Motivation or ideas for digital innovation occur for different reasons and CTOs 

must be aware of them and balance attention.  

•  CTOs as innovation catalysts must ensure that their organisation is capitalising 

on these ideas, opportunities, and sources.
