Week 7: Neural Networks, Generative AI and Applications 

ISB CTO 

Video 1: Neural Networks, Generative AI and Applications: 
Introduction 

Let  us  begin  with  the  trends  in  global  technology  industry.  Now,  globally,  a  lot  of 
industries are being disrupted, transformed and improved using AI, machine learning, 
deep learning and generative AI. So, that is something that we all need to understand: 
how  it  works,  and  what  kind  of  changes  it  is  making,  what  kind  of  changes  it  can 
potentially make. Then the related concepts of that comes, which is based on this AI, 
machine learning, deep learning and generative AIs, IoT and Web 3.0. And there, we 
have  seen  the  development  coming  in  form  of  technologies  like  blockchains.  Then 
comes  virtual  reality,  augmented  reality,  mixed  reality  and  metaverse.  They  have 
potential to create lot of new businesses across industries, and they are closely related 
with virtual assistants and chatbots that is already disrupting many parts of businesses. 
And  finally,  one  of  the  most  emerging  trends  right  now  is  industry  4.0  and  5.0  in 
conjunction with 3D printing. And although, this industry 4.0 and 5.0 provides a lot of 
new solutions, they also create new challenges, especially in terms of cyber security, 
because  now  things  are  more  connected,  and  they  create  more  opportunity  for  the 
hackers or any intruders to get into the system. 

Video 2: Digitisation, Digitalisation and Digital Transformation 

So, let us begin with that how AI and machine learning are changing businesses. To 
understand this component, we need to foresee how businesses are doing digitisation, 
digitalisation and digital transformation and what is the fundamental difference between 
these  three  things.  They  are  related  but  not the  same  thing.  Digitisation  simply talks 
about how to convert the analog data into digital data. And once we are able to convert 
that,  then  we  talk  about  digitisation,  where  we  start  thinking  about  which  kind  of 
processes could be automated. And we have to start with the low-hanging fruit, which 
means the processes where we can get the most value by automation, and that process 
is defined as digitalisation. And once we are able to do digitalisation, then we move to 
digital transformation. Now, digital transformation is the ultimate goal because this can 
give us the most benefit of all the digitisation and digitalisation. But digital transformation 
in  itself  is not  just  a  technical  process.  It  is a  holistic  change  in  the  company,  in  the 
organisations. You have to change the culture; you have to change the work style of 
people. Because digital transformation is never successful unless we can change the 
mindset of executives as well as managers in the organisation. Now, all of those things 
are  not  new.  We  have  seen  this  several  times.  It  is  not  the  digital  transformation  is 
happening  just  now.  If  we  go  back,  things  like  ERP  system  or  enterprise  resource 
planning systems that we saw started coming in late 90s and early 2000s, those were 
the  digital  transformation  because  they  fundamentally  changed  businesses,  and 
businesses started thinking about data in a new way. But all the successful examples 
of  digital  transformation  are  the  ones  where  not  only  the  technology  implementation 

 ISB CTO

happened  in  the  right  way,  but  the  culture  of  the  organisation  change  in  the  right 
manner. 

One of the very successful example of ERP implementation in late 90s was at Cisco. 
And this is a classic case that how they took the whole idea of talking to people within 
the organisation, taking the top-down approach where executives come and take the 
ownership of the project and make this happen. And with all the newer transformation 
that we are seeing right now, that we are going to see in next few years, we need similar 
kind of mindset. If we just approach this whole thing as a technology, it's not going to 
work. We have to identify the pain point in businesses. The ultimate goal is to solve 
business problems, not just to implement technology and how the mindset of people 
within the organisation can change. But if you really think about these three pieces, they 
are like a pyramid. We start with digitisation because we need a digital data before any 
of this can happen. And, for example, in India, lot of healthcare data is still not digitised. 
So, first we have to do digitisation. Similar things happen if you look at the US before 
Affordable Care Act or Obamacare came, lot of healthcare data was not even digitised. 
So, there was a mandate that it needs to be digitised.  

Now  once  digitisation  happens,  then  we  move  up  in  the  pyramid  and  we  go  to 
digitalisation,  because  now  my  data  is  digitised  and  now  I  can  think  about  how  to 
automate processes. Now some of the companies in India who have been proactive in 
the healthcare domain in digitising data, they have moved to digitalisation. One very 
good example is LV Prasad Eye Institute, which is one of the largest eye care network. 
They  started  their  digitisation  much  earlier  than  rest  of  the  country,  and  they  have 
moved to lot of digitalisation. And those kind of things we need to think about how we 
can do in different industry. Manufacturing industry across the world, but especially in 
India, is going through lot of that both digitisation and digitalisation. Now once we have 
done  digitalisation,  then  we  move  to  digital  transformation.  Once  we  are  able  to 
automate processes, we have to streamline the process so that we can move to the 
digital transformation. And that is where we transform the institutions. 

Video 3: Artificial Intelligence, Neural Network and Deep Learning 

So, if we think about the whole ecosystem of AI, AI did not start today. If we really be 
conservative, then we will say that the whole discussion on AI and machine learning 
started at least during World War 2, when Alan Turing was tasked to break the code to 
see in a very fast manner within 24 hours. That's when the real action started. Then, lot 
of different researchers in 1950s got together, and we even started talking about image 
analytics, how we can do that. 

Lot of newer method like logistic regression started being used. Now if we started talking 
about these things in 40s and 50s, what happened in between and where are we right 
now?  That's  an  interesting  part  here.  So,  you  know,  the  goal  has  been  that  can  we 
mimic human brain. And why do we want to do that? Because human brain can do lot 
of stuff that machines cannot do. 

Things like common sense, things like intuition. So, how can we build that into machine? 
And also, machines require lot of data. Human brain does not require lot of data. A kid 

 ISB CTO 

2  

 
   
  
  
can  look  at  a  horse  and  maybe  two  horses  and  say,  "Yeah,  this  is  a  horse."  For  a 
machine, it will take thousands of data to realise it's a horse. So, what is missing here 
in the neural net or neural network? Let's look at neural net. So, neural net, the main 
challenge has been how to understand why brain does what it does and that has been 
the core challenge for data scientist, for computer scientist and neurologist. So, in order 
to fix that problem, we try to look at different approach. Now one of the thing we all need 
to understand is that why brain does what it does is based on something happens inside 
the brain that we don't know and that is referred to as hidden layer. 

So, hidden layer is a part of the brain that essentially is confusing part in many ways, 
an unclear part but it does something. For example, if a kid watches somebody running 
on  the  road  and  he  says  that  this person  falls,  then  the  kid  watches  somebody  else 
running on the road, that person also falls. So, kid's brain does something in the hidden 
layer and the output is that I am not going to run on that road. But how this processing 
happened, that has been a mystery. Now in the neural net, we try to imitate that. Now 
one of the very interesting code that I will tell you is based on a movie which was made 
on the life of Alan Turing, called The Imitation Game. And in one of the scenes, Alan 
Turing's character is asked that do you think we can build a machine that can think like 
human? And Alan Turing had a very interesting take on that. So, Alan Turing basically 
responds  in  the  sense  that  something  like,  it's  not  about  thinking  like  human,  it's  all 
about  thinking.  Now,  if  a  machine  thinks  but  does  not  think  like  a  human,  is  it  not 
thinking? 

And  that's  a  very good  question  to  ask.  If one  person  is thinking differently  from  the 
other  person,  does  that  mean  the  other  person  is  not  thinking?  And  that's  a  very 
philosophical question as well. So, since two human do not think in a similar manner, 
we should not even try to build a machine which will think like human, because which 
human?    So,  Alan  Turing's  point  of  view  was  that  we  should  all  focus  on  building 
machines that can think. And if we are able to do that, I think we are in good shape. 
And that was a very good starting point that how we can do that, how we can bring the 
thinking process in the brain. 

And that's where the progress of machine learning started happening. But if we look 
and go back to the history, since late 1940s, until 2015 or so, we really did not see much 
growth.  But  suddenly,  we  started  seeing  a  big  growth  on  all  these  deep  learning 
methods, where we could deal with images, videos and so on. So, what really happened 
here? Let's understand. One big thing that happened was that we were able to partially 
crack the hidden layer. So, we told that machines will take input and they will start doing 
something that we don't know why they are doing. And that happens by a lot of trial and 
error, and they give an output. So, we were able to somehow replicate brain and get 
results  that  we  were  not  able  to  get  with  any  other  model.  But  that  brings  a  new 
challenge that explainability is gone. 

Now we cannot explain why we got this result and that is leading to lot of debate and 
discussion  right  now.  It's  a  serious  problem.  See,  all  these  algorithms  have  two  big 
problems. One is that, since I cannot explain, it can create lot of biases in the system, 
and we will never know. And second, what about the ethical . How do the machines 

 ISB CTO 

3  

 
   
  
  
deal with ethical issues. So, these things still need to be resolved, but the good point is 
that  we  have  the  algorithms,  we  are  discussing,  we  are  applying  them  for  many 
solutions and also we are researching on how to resolve the problem. So, all business 
executives  right  now  need  to  think  about  how  we  can  apply  all  these  things  in  a 
responsible manner. Responsible manner is very critical here. So, going further on this 
part, one of the field that has got the most advancement in last four, five, six years is 
the Natural Language Processing or NLP. Now what does NLP do? NLP takes different 
kind of text and try to understand not only the text but also the sentiment behind it. It 
could be written, it could be spoken, it could be coming even in terms of sometimes 
videos, but convert them to simple language that another human can understand. And 
we  have  made  a  big  leap  into  that.  And  thanks  to  companies  like  Alphabet,  Meta, 
Microsoft,  they  all  have  developed  a  lot  of  good  algorithms  and  they  have  their  own 
platforms and there are applications created by third party. One of them which is very 
popular right now is LIWC where one can just put all the text, which could be social 
media reviews, online reviews and it will give you bunch of variables which could be 
how happy tone is, how positive tone is, how authentic the text is, how much formality 
is there in the text, many such thing. 

We can be very powerful when you think about how to apply that to solve problems. In 
customer service, it's a gold mine. But many other places, we are able to do the text 
mining from the notes written by doctors. We are also able to do text mining from court 
cases. But one of the important piece here is that you have to understand the context. 
You cannot have one size fit all solution here because healthcare, the language is very 
different.  When  you  go  to  the  law,  it's  very  different  language.  When  you  go  to  the 
customer service for an e-commerce company, the language is very different. So, right 
now, most of the development is happening in the vertical sector. How can we develop 
these methods for different industry? And that's where I think the real value lies and 
India is taking a big leap into that, especially the places where we have lot of data. 

Video 4: Machine Learning Methods 

The  most  popular  machine  learning  method  has  been  supervised  learning.  Now, 
supervised learning simply requires a data where you have labelled it. For example, in 
the insurance industry, if you say that this is the details of the person, this is the details 
of the loan the person took and this person never returned the loan. Now, that is  the 
labelling  part  because  I  know  this  person  never  returned  the  loan,  so  I  have  that 
information. Or it could be that this is the person, these are the details of the person, 
this is the purchase history of the person. And this person, after all these things stopped 
buying from me. So, that is another labelled data. So, labelled means I know the final 
outcome. Once that is given, you train your model and based on that training, I can do 
prediction  in  the  future.  That  gives  the  most  accuracy,  and  it  is  widely  used  across 
industry. The challenge is sometimes we do not have labelled data. For example, if I 
am  looking for the  fake  reviewers  on  a  review page  or do  I  know which  one  is fake, 
which  one  is  not,  I  may  not  know  for  sure.  So,  that  is  where  the  labelling  becomes 
challenging.  So,  when  labelling  is  not  possible,  we  go  to  a  method  of  unsupervised 
learning. In unsupervised learning, we do not give a label. Unsupervised learning simply 
says that these are the different categories in this data. This is different, this is type A 

 ISB CTO 

4  

 
   
  
  
data, this is type B data, this is type C data and so on. And whenever the new data 
come,  they  will  put  it  in  type  A,  B  or  C,  very  much  like  clustering  them  into  different 
groups. Now this works very well when the data is not labelled. And we are seeing more 
and more so unlabelled data especially in the niche areas like health care, law or even 
some of the more traditional cases. Even in online review, like you don't know the fake 
reviews and so on. So, unsupervised learning is very powerful, but it requires more data 
to get trained, and also it may not have as high accuracy as supervised learning. Now, 
we did a project with company called Yelp, which is online review system. They had 
some labelling of the fake reviewers, not reviews, reviewers. We took that and we apply 
supervised learning for that. But then there were lot of data company had where there 
was number labelling. So, we took the data and did unsupervised learning. So, you can 
do  that,  and  you  can  even  use  the  mix  of  that.  And  most  of  these  methods  use 
something  called  feature  engineering  approach,  where  you  look  at  different  features 
and try to make the result. 

But  the  future  really  lies  in  reinforcement  learning.  What  is  reinforcement  learning? 
There we are getting closer to human brain. So, think about how human brain works. In 
human brain, what we do to our kids is that if they make a mistake, we give them some 
penalty.  If  they  do  the  right  thing,  we  give  them  reward.  That's  how  reinforcement 
learning  works.  It  learns  by  making  mistakes.  So,  whenever  it  makes  mistake,  the 
system will give a penalty. That penalty could be for example, in a driverless car, the 
penalty  will  be  the  human  intervention  happens.  Very  much  what  Tesla  did.  See  all 
these  companies,  Google,  BMW,  General  Motors,  they  all  were  trying  Uber  for  their 
driverless cars for quite some time. But what Tesla did, they had some features. They 
put the cars on the road and basically they allowed the customers or drivers to use their 
features, autonomous features. And they say that whenever the person is taking over, 
that is trained into the system that, the car made a mistake. And by taking so much data 
all over the place, they have got pretty good system. You can drive hundreds of miles 
without much intervention. You have to touch in between for a few seconds. After a few 
seconds, that's it.  

So, reinforcement learning can help in many ways. Another very good application of 
reinforcement  learning  is  when  we  create  the  general-purpose  robots.  Say,  all  the 
general-purpose  robots  required  more  agility.  They  have  to  react  to  many  situation, 
right? Because they can carry boxes, they can put items from one place to other place. 
And  possibly  in  the  future,  they  can  also  give  us  massage.  But  that  is  possible  only 
when we combine reinforcement learning with other kind of learning method. And that's 
where the future really lies. Future will be some combination of all of these things. 

Video 5: Generative AI 

Now we have talked a lot about AI, machine learning and clearly, this is where the future 
lies. But one thing that happened, especially in last six months, is a talk about generative 
AI. Now generative AI is fundamentally different from traditional AI in some sense, but 
they  are  also  very  similar  with  traditional  AI  in  many  senses.  So,  generative  AI  is 
designed to generate content, not just do the prediction, fraud detection and what item 
to offer to my customer, they can generate content. Now this is very  good, also very 

 ISB CTO 

5  

 
   
  
  
challenging.  So,  now  generative  AI  can  create  images,  lot  of  GIS,  geographical 
information system, we have lot of satellite images. How can we convert satellite images 
to more usable images and vice versa, that's where lot of generative AI is being used. 
One  very  good  application  of  generative  AI  is  what  law  enforcement  is  using.  It  can 
convert its sketches to pictures very nicely, and they have done a very good job. And if 
somebody  has  not  tried,  they  should  always  try,  the  different  ChatGPT  and  other 
generative AI is coming. 

If we think about the power, so one of the estimates says that by 2025, generative AI 
will be producing 10% of all data. Now this is very interesting. We have seen very similar 
thing when World Wide Web came. The kind of data it generated; nobody had expected 
earlier. So, we are going to see a lot of that here, which is very good news, because 
World Wide Web was very successful. It helps us in doing many, many things. All the 
pharmaceutical companies are looking at generative AI very carefully. Pharmaceutical 
is one of the industries where lot of money goes in R&D for drug discovery, very similar 
to the oil companies, where to drill, lot of research goes into that. Now ChatGPT and 
generative AI in general has the potential to help you in drug discovery to help you in 
deciding where to drill, and those are phenomenal applications. So, those companies 
are looking at it very carefully. Many manufacturers are using generative AI to see how 
to  enhance  their  product,  what  new  features  to  add  in  the  product.  That's  also  very 
difficult with the traditional AI. 

If we look in logistics and transportation, which highly rely on all this location services, 
generative AI is being used to convert all the satellite images to map views and so on. 
In the travel industry, generative AI is helping in face detection, verification systems at 
airport. It can also create a full-face picture of a passenger from some photo taken from 
different angle, which is not very clear and vice versa. In healthcare, lot of X-rays and 
CT scans are being converted to photorealistic images with the help of generative AI, 
and  it  can  help  in  diagnosing  dangerous  diseases  like  cancer  and  so  on.  So,  this  is 
fantastic. 

n marketing, generative AI can help you in planning your campaign. How to design your 
campaign, not just to check which campaign is good or bad, which can increase your 
upselling and cross-selling. Again, great example, but these things don't come without 
problems.  The  first  thing  happened  when  generative  AI  came  that  people  started 
creating ads with pictures and videos of people who look realistic. Now, this is a very 
interesting question. Can somebody create an image of a celebrity and use that in the 
ad?  The  law  is not  very clear on  that.  See, something  like,  I  can create  somebody's 
cartoon and use that. I cannot use that person's actual picture though. But I can create 
a cartoon and do that, because I created that. This is not that person's picture. Now the 
image is created by generative AI is not very different because machine has created it. 
It is not the actual picture. This picture does not exist, but machine has created it. The 
only problem is that this picture looks extremely realistic, and this goes back to the point 
of  Alan  Turing.  Alan  Turing  had  created  "The  Imitation  Game,"  which  says  that,  can 
machines  fool  human  or  experts?    Can  machines  create  system  which  cannot  be 
differentiated  by  experts?    And  once  that  happens,  then  we  take  the  big  leap.  More 

 ISB CTO 

6  

 
   
  
  
recently, we see lot of videos coming, where videos look extremely realistic, and the 
problem starts happening. 

And then in April of 2023, that's when the big thing happened that AI created music of 
Drake and Weeknd, which sounded exactly like them. It is not very clear who created 
lyrics and music though, but singing certainly was done by AI, and they released it. Now 
the problem is that they sing exactly like them, but the machine is singing it. Now, this 
is a big breakthrough because once that happens, now both the applications type and 
challenge  side  becomes  very  critical.  Now  who  is  getting  right  to  what?  It  can  be 
misused badly, and it can be used in very nice way. 

Another research that is going on, how can we train machine, so that it does not require 
tons of data like human? Human does not require tons of data to train our brain. How 
can we do that? And that method is called "less than one"-shot or LO-shot, where the 
goal is to generate result with very little amount of data. But some of the scientists and 
researchers feel that next AI is OI, which they call Organoid Intelligence. So, some of 
the researchers at Johns Hopkins, they have not created a human brain, but they have 
created  something  which  resembles  tiny  version  of  human  brain.  It  is a  dot  size  cell 
structure that has neurons that are capable of brain-like function. It is not a brain. It is 
capable of brain-like function. They call it intelligence in a dish, and they say that this 
power of brain organoids into a biological hardware can be more energy efficient than 
supercomputers and they can revolutionise in many ways. 

In  AI,  machine  learning,  they  can  do  pharmaceutical  testing  for  diseases  like 
Alzheimer's where we have not made lot of breakthrough. So, this could be the next big 
thing. And you can find this article, where I talk about the common sense conundrum 
for AI. And here, the key thing is that AI cannot do common sense and intuition. So, 
how can we build that? And I can give you one example. When I was working with one 
healthcare  project  in  Philadelphia,  and  we  were  looking  at  diabetic  feet.  So,  can  we 
detect the diabetes in a feet just by looking at thermal images? Our algorithm did very 
well.  We  looked  at  thermal  images,  we  could  predict  it  well.  But  whenever  feet  was 
tilted, then algorithm was not working well. Now, for the human it is very easy. They can 
just turn their head and make the image straight. But machine could not do that. So, 
that  is  where  the  human-machine  collaboration  comes  into  picture,  so  that  you  can 
basically go and create help machine by tilting the feet, that is what we did. We created 
a device so that feet is tilted and then machine help us. And I think that is where the 
key is, like common sense and intuition part to get even to the cutting-edge AI is going 
to  take  time,  but  we  can  help  that  happen.  And  once  that  happens,  we  can  find 
something else that machines cannot do.  

And there are many jobs which are not likely to be replaced by machine. But if you think 
of some of the jobs which are most likely to be replaced by robots, including like some 
of the insurance underwriters, why do we need them? Tax preparers. We are already 
seeing that happening. Some of the telemarketers, machines can do that very well.  

There was a study done by some researchers at Johns Hopkins. We talk about, can 
ChatGPT give women accurate advice on breast cancer?  And I have talked about that 
to different media outlets as well, and the results are very good. But the problem is that 

 ISB CTO 

7  

 
   
  
  
it is not perfectly accurate. It is so good that general users start believing that it is very 
good, and that is very dangerous because right now, the results of generative AI need 
to  be  examined  by  an  expert.  Because  an  expert  can  pick  the  90%  good  one  and 
remove the 10% bad one. But general people cannot do it. So, the use of generative AI 
is  good  for  general purpose  thing  like  improve  my  writing,  rewrite  it  for me,  write  an 
essay for me, that is okay. There also we have some concerns, but it is okay. But if you 
get into doing the disease control or finding what symptoms I have or getting into doing 
investments for me, which many people have started doing with all these TikTok and 
so on, this is extremely dangerous because it can set us apart. 

In one of the articles that you can find the link, I talk about how ChatGPT generating 
fake news stories. They create links that did not exist. They create citations that does 
not  exist  because  they  go  word  by  word.  Now  these  are  dangerous.  We  have  to 
separate  fact  from  fiction.  That  is extremely important.  Without  that,  we  all  will  be  in 
trouble. And that is why Elon Musk  and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and some 
others  signed  a  petition  that,  can  government  put  some  pause  to  this  risk?  And 
interestingly,  government  reacted  to  that.  Not  only  US  government,  Chinese 
government  and  European  Union,  they  all  have  worked  on  this.  Now,  Indian 
government actually interestingly came out and said that they will not put any control. 
Now, that was very interesting move when they did that. 

Now, another big thing happened here is that the godfather of modern AI, who actually 
made  all  this  deep  learning  happen  in  last  10  years,  his  name  is  Geoffrey  Hinton. 
Geoffrey Hinton was at University of Toronto and then he moved to Google, which is 
Alphabet,  and  basically  started  all  these  things.  And  some  of  his  students  went  to 
companies  like  Facebook  and  others.  That  is  why  Google  and  Facebook  were 
generating most of these algorithms, or we can say Alphabet and Meta now. But he 
resigned,  and after that  he  told,  I  have made  a big mistake  by  creating  it.  And he  is 
comparing this with some of the dangerous thing that had been created. It can take that 
it can cause serious harm. And one of the interviews he mentioned that, only thing that 
gives little peace to him is that if he had not done it, somebody else would have done 
it.  So,  that  creates  lot  of  question  mark  in  all  of  the  things  we  are  talking  here  like 
generative AI, ChatGPT and all. If he thinks it is dangerous, are we missing something 
here, which is an interesting thing to think about. 

There  is  another  article  which  you  will  find  the  link,  where  I  go  in  detail  about  how 
different governments, what kind of regulations can do. I think the biggest thing here is 
how to create accountability, transparency and make sure these things do not have bias 
and any kind of unethical behaviour. Now the companies who are generating algorithm, 
they  need  to  be  liable  for  that.  If  we  don't  put  them,  then  we  can  get  into  a  very 
dangerous path.  

So, I want you guys to watch this video, which is very interesting, and come back. So, 
you  have  seen  this  video  and  you  can  see  how  the  generative  AI  has  taken  us  to 
different  level and  it  is going  to  go  further.  So,  lot  of  business  solutions are  going  to 
develop  or  is  being  developed  across  the  world  on  especially  in  the  side  of  content 
generation, helping writers. So, I think many such applications will come, which will help

human in doing lot of repetitive task. And I think which is great, but still, we are not ready 
it for prime time and many of the things, but we have to be watchful. We have to make 
sure that we are not on the blind spot with this technology. India has taken an interesting 
stand in terms of generative AI, at least in the starting part and we have not seen lot of 
applications use cases coming, but this is still developing. So, we are going to see a lot 
of new things happening in this domain.  

Video 6: Digitisation and AI in India 

Now if you think of real digital transformation in the Indian economy, this whole digital 
transformation  is  really  becoming  a  charger  for  the  Indian  economy,  and  they  are 
powering a self-reliant India or what we call Atmanirbhar Bharat. All of this is fuelled by 
digital  transformation  and  Indian  IT  industry  has  pushed  its  boundaries.  They  have 
accomplished  incredible  feats  in  the  near  past.  It  has  grown  at  a  cumulative  annual 
growth rate of more than 15% from 196 billion to over 225 billion in financial year 2022. 
Now if the current rate continues, then it will go to 394 billion by 2027. However, the 
need of the hour is right now to invest in digital transformation and achieve even 25% 
cumulative  growth  rate.  If  we  do  that,  then  India  has  the  potential  to  go  close  to 
becoming a $1 trillion digital economy within this decade. And that's the goal right now, 
and the way things are going, it looks very promising.  

Now, all of these things what we see, the digital transformation in India and worldwide, 
R&D  has  played  a  very  important  role.  So,  to  keep  up  with  all  this  India's  digital 
transformation, there need to be continuous research and development and that is the 
one thing where the focus should not be changed. If we change the focus from there, 
then it is going to be a big problem. And India also need to integrate next generation 
technology  to  build  tools across  industry.  Like  some  of  the  low-hanging  fruit here  is, 
manufacturing,  healthcare,  agriculture.  A  lot  of  digital  transformation  right  now  is 
happening in agriculture with simple sensors and things going to even advance things 
like  blockchain,  and  India  has  the  potential  to  take  a  lead  in  many  of  these 
transformation. And if all these countries can work together to make this happen, I think 
everybody will benefit from the process of digital transformation. So, if we look at why 
and how this is happening across country and in India, one of the big factor has been 
lot of policy reforms, that has accelerated innovation. In every country we see, but more 
so in India.  

Now,  if  you  think  about  the  ongoing  IT  evolution,  emergence  of  India  as  the  world's 
leading  outsourcing  destination  accounting  for  more  than  50%  of  global  outsourcing 
market and this has been happened because of lot of government interventions and 
policy changes. So, it is very interesting time to look at all of those things. And today 
Indian IT exports account for more than 51% of total revenue. So, clearly IT plays an 
extremely important role and India has the potential to build a $6 billion plus industry in 
IT in the next five years. So, that's very interesting and promising. Now if we think about 
how we can improve here, and how India can improve, in what dimension, one of the 
biggest  hurdle  that  is  pulling  India  back  in  terms  of  the  IT  innovation  and  digital 
transformation  has  been  that  India  is  globally  recognised  as  the  service  hub  of  the 
world. But, to build a powerful ecosystem that works for all, you have to move to concept 

 ISB CTO

to market hub of the world. And here the move has to happen from both industry as well 
as policy makers. You have to get into innovation, and you have to create new product 
not just provide service, and that is critical part to get to the next level. 

So, Digital India framework, which is right now serving as a guiding principle for all the 
digital  transformation,  especially  in  manufacturing,  logistics,  healthcare,  banking  and 
finance,  retail,  education  or  even  agriculture.  Their  policy  changes  are  needed  to 
expand  government  initiatives  to  have  more  startups  in  India  and  how  they  can  be 
funded. And over the  last  three  decades  if  we  see, IT  sector has  emerged  as a  key 
contributor to economic growth in India. This is the time where India can take the next 
leap and really become a leader or bigger leader in this game. Now, let us think about 
what is happening in India. Where is India in terms of AI? Now, this is very interesting. 
The  National  AI  Portal  of  India,  which  is  a  joint  venture  by  different  entity,  including 
NASSCOM and others. This has been set up to prepare the nation for AI future. So, it 
is  a  great  initiative.  In  2018,  NITI  Aayog  which  is  National  Institute  for  Transforming 
India, they released a national strategy for AI, where the aim is to position India as a 
global  AI  leader.  And  all  of  these  things  have  really  expedited  the  growth  of  many 
applications around India. Now here, the focus has been not only on data utilisation, 
research  and  development,  but  also  how  to  skill  the  workforce  and  enable  the 
ecosystem for AI adoption, which is critical.  

Remember,  digital  transformation  requires  the  overall  change.  Digital  transformation 
cannot happen just because technology has grown. It requires lot of mindset change. It 
requires the right skillset in the people. Now, there is a lot of discussion going on around, 
will  machines  take  the  job  of  human?  What  really  happens  is  yes,  there  will  be  a 
transition period, where lot of jobs will be taken by machine. But the real value always 
comes when the human-machine collaboration happens. Somebody need to train those 
machines and who will be training those machines? The people who were doing the job 
earlier, they know it the best. So, they will be doing better job than what they were doing 
earlier. Because, machines can do the low-level job, what they were doing, and they 
can do the higher level job, and they can earn more money actually. Entry-level salaries 
are going to go up because of AI and all. But there is a catch. And the catch is that lot 
of retooling and reskilling is needed. If we don't do that, then the whole society will be 
in the mess. Not maybe everybody, but a big chunk of the society.  

Now, how can retooling and reskilling happen? It has to happen at different level. All 
the educational institutions have to change their curriculum. All the people have to be 
proactive in learning new things and may be most importantly, the government have to 
have policies where they can provide this retooling and reskilling, especially to people 
who do not have access to resources very easily. Now India has witnessed a surge in 
AI startup. There are lot of companies we see Zomato, Swiggy, Ola, Flipkart. They have 
integrated AI into their platform to enhance service and optimise their operations. But 
there are many other startups which provide AI driven solution, and we are seeing this 
worldwide but a lot so in India. 

So,  all  of  these  things  happening  because  there  are  several  incubators  and  that  is 
where the educational institutions, governments, all are helping and that various sectors 

 ISB CTO

in  India  are  leveraging  all  those  things.  One  of  the  big  has  been  healthcare.  Now 
healthcare in India even lot of data was not even digitised. But what we are saying as 
things  are  getting  digitised,  they  are  moving  very  fast  on  disease  diagnosis, 
personalised medicine, drug discovery. One very good example is a company called 
HealthPlix. They are taking all this analogue data or handwritten notes and convert that 
to digital format. 

Another very good company is Cloudphysician, which I work very closely with. It is a 
Bangalore-based company, one of the largest tele-ICU company in India. And they have 
used AI, machine learning for lot of different things. Personalised cancer treatment is a 
big area where lot of work going on. We did some work on personalised treatment for 
breast cancer patient, but now we have extended that to other kind of cancers. And we 
are working with several partners in India and the US to see how this is different. And I 
think that is where lot of action is going to happen. Financial institutions are using for 
fraud detection, assessment, customer service. 

Similarly, e-commerce platforms are adopting AI for their supply chain management. 
And don't forget agriculture, education, transportation, they are all using different kinds 
of applications. So, if we really think about the market size in India and AI, this is really 
booming right now. And looking at the numbers, we can say that this is going to grow 
at the exponential rate in whatever way we can think. A lot of focus and push will be on 
non-IT sectors. So, this means that we have to be very proactive in applying this so that 
we  are  on  top  of  the  game.  As  well  as,  we  have  to  see  this  implementation  across 
industry. One of the things that I have noticed is that, if I am in the airline industry, I 
don't want to see what is happening in e-commerce because that is not related to me. 
Now that is a very myopic approach. In fact, the cross-learning is humongous there. So, 
unless we start thinking about how to learn from different industry, different countries, 
different kinds of applications, I think we will not be successful in this process. So, the 
companies  who  have  this  proactive  approach  and  thinking  about  more  open 
mindedness,  those  are  the  ones  who  will  succeed.  And  the  ones  who  has  closed 
minded or myopic view that I only look in my industry what is happening in my country, 
they will be left behind. So, that is very important piece to move forward.
