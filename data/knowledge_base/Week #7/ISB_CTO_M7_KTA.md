Week 7: Neural Networks, Generative AI and Applications 

Video 1: Introduction 

•  The global technology industry is experiencing disruption and transformation through AI, 

machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. 

•  Emerging trends include IoT, Web 3.0, blockchain, virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed 
reality, metaverse, and their impact on various industries, including virtual assistants and 
chatbots. 
Industry 4.0 and 5.0, along with 3D printing, are emerging trends with potential benefits but 
also pose cybersecurity challenges due to increased connectivity.

Video 2: Digitisation, Digitalisation and Digital Transformation 

•  AI and machine learning are driving significant changes in businesses, requiring a thorough 

understanding. 

•  Distinguishing between digitisation, digitalisation, and digital transformation is crucial in 

comprehending their roles in business evolution. 

•  Digitisation involves converting analogue data into digital format, serving as the foundational 

step. 

•  Digitalisation follows digitisation and focuses on automating processes, beginning with low-

hanging fruit for automation. 

•  Digital transformation, the ultimate goal, entails holistic changes in culture and work styles 

within organisations, necessitating a shift in executive and managerial mindsets. 

•  Success in digital transformation relies not only on technology but also on cultural change 

within the organisation. 

•  The three phases of digitisation, digitalisation, and digital transformation can be visualised as 

a pyramid, each building upon the previous one. 

•  The transformation journey should address business pain points and prioritise problem-

solving over technology implementation. 

•  Digital transformation goes beyond technology, requiring a comprehensive shift in 

organisational culture and practices. 

Video 3: Artificial Intelligence, Neural Network and Deep Learning 

•  AI's roots can be traced back to World War II when Alan Turing was tasked with rapid code-

breaking, marking the start of AI discussions. 

•  The objective of AI is to emulate the human brain, which possesses qualities like common 

sense and intuition, distinct from machines. 

•  Machines require extensive data, while humans can identify objects with limited exposure, 

raising questions about neural networks' capabilities. 

•  The "hidden layer" in the brain, responsible for complex processing, remains enigmatic and is 

a core challenge for AI researchers. 

•  Alan Turing's perspective shifted AI's focus towards building machines that can think, rather 

than trying to replicate human thinking. 

•  The period from the late 1940s to 2015 saw limited AI growth, but deep learning methods 

have since emerged, although they raise concerns about explainability and ethics. 

•  Challenges include the potential for biases in unexplainable AI algorithms and the need to 

address ethical issues. 

•  Despite these challenges, AI development and research are ongoing, emphasising the 

importance of responsible AI applications. 

•  Natural Language Processing (NLP) has made significant strides, enabling the understanding 

of sentiment in various forms of text and speech.

Video 4: Machine Learning Methods 

•  Supervised learning relies on labelled data for accurate predictions in various industries. 
•  Unlabelled data poses a challenge when determining outcomes, such as identifying fake 

reviews. 

•  Unsupervised learning categorises data into groups without labels, suitable for scenarios with 

no clear labelling. 

•  Unsupervised learning may not be as accurate as supervised learning and requires more 

data. 

•  Combining supervised and unsupervised learning with feature engineering is common in 

practice. 

•  Reinforcement learning, inspired by human brain learning, penalises mistakes and rewards 

correct actions. 

•  Reinforcement learning has potential in creating agile general-purpose robots. 
•  The future of machine learning likely involves a combination of supervised, unsupervised, and 

reinforcement learning methods to address diverse challenges and applications. 

Video 5: Generative AI 

•  Generative AI is designed to create content, including images and converting satellite images. 
It finds applications in pharmaceuticals, helping in drug discovery, and assisting in decision-
• 
making for various industries. 
It aids in logistics, transportation, travel, healthcare, marketing, and more. 

• 
•  Ethical concerns arise with the creation of highly realistic content. 
•  The development of common sense and intuition in AI remains a challenge. 
•  Concerns include generative AI's potential to create fake news and the need to separate fact 

from fiction. 

•  Calls for accountability, transparency, and bias prevention in AI development are growing. 
•  Vigilance is necessary as generative AI continues to advance and impact various sectors. 

Video 6: Digitisation and AI in India 

•  Digital transformation is a driving force for India's economy, fostering self-reliance 

("Atmanirbhar Bharat") and economic growth. 

•  The Indian IT industry has achieved remarkable growth, with an annual growth rate exceeding 

15%, and it's projected to reach 394 billion by 2027. 

•  Policy reforms have played a crucial role in accelerating innovation in India, particularly in the 

• 

IT sector. 
India aims to become a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) through initiatives like the 
National AI Portal and a national AI strategy. 

•  Retooling and reskilling of the workforce are crucial for a smooth transition to AI-driven 

industries. 

•  Cross-industry learning and open-mindedness are critical for the successful implementation of 

AI and digital transformation. 

•  Proactive approaches to learning from different industries and countries are essential for 

staying ahead in the game.
