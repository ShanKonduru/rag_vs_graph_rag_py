“W e were behind on automation and digitization, and we finally closed the gap. We

don’t want to be left behind again, but we aren’t sure how to think about

generative AI.”

That’s the sentiment shared by many global executives, given the speed with which
[ 1 ]

 is advancing in the business world. The

generative artificial intelligence (gen AI)

technology is accessible, ubiquitous, and promises to have a significant impact on

organizations and the economy over the next decade.

Anyone can use gen AI, with little or no formal training or technical know-how. It is being

embedded in everyday tools, like email, word processing applications, and meeting

software, which means the technology is already positioned to radically transform how

people work. And McKinsey research shows that gen AI could enable automation of up to

70 percent of business activities, across almost all occupations, between now and 2030,

adding trillions of dollars in value to the global economy.

[ 2 ]

Meanwhile, technologists keep reminding us that gen AI is only in its nascent stages of

development and usage. This smart technology is only going to get more intelligent—and

those who don’t learn to work with it, starting now, will be left behind.

[ 3 ]

In this supercharged environment, how can organizations do more than just “keep up”?

What strategies, structures, and talent management approaches will business leaders need

to adopt to prepare their organizations for a gen-AI-driven future? We examine these and

other critical questions in this article.

The situation is evolving rapidly, and there is, frankly, no one right answer to the question of

how to successfully roll out gen AI in the organization—business context matters.

But to start, business leaders will need to think broadly about how the rollout of Gen AI

could affect their organizations day to day—especially their people. Employees and

managers should have a clear understanding of gen AI’s strengths and weaknesses and

how use of the technology is linked to the organization’s strategic objectives. Given the

technology’s potential to accelerate automation, senior leaders could counter employees’

prevailing fears of “replacement and loss” with messaging about gen AI’s potential for

“augmentation and improvement”—and its ability to significantly enhance the employee

experience. Imagine, for example, a world with fewer meetings and more time to think.

The central task for senior leaders, then, is to demystify the technology for others; that will

mean taking a step back to assess the strategic implications of gen AI, or the risks and

opportunities for industries and business models. As leaders build a compelling narrative for

the use of gen AI, they will also need to identify two or three high-impact applications to

explore and bring employees along on a value-creating journey—taking gen AI initiatives

from pilot test to rapid scaling to “business as usual” status. Senior leaders will also need to

commit to building the required roles, skills, and capabilities (now and for the future), so they

can continually test and learn with gen AI and stay ahead of competitors.

Are you thinking broadly enough about gen
AI’s potential impact?

McKinsey research suggests that, because of the emergence of gen AI, about half of today’s

business activities could be automated a decade earlier than previous estimates had

projected.

[ 4 ]

 Gen-AI-enabled automation has already begun—and, as the research shows, is

likely to affect hours, tasks, and responsibilities for workers across wage rates and

educational backgrounds. In fact, the research shows that gen AI will have an especially

profound effect on professions traditionally requiring higher levels of education, such as

educators and lawyers.

[ 5 ]

Gen AI is also likely to inform discussions in the C-suite about how the company creates

value and whether the addition of gen AI capabilities allows for industry or business model

reinvention. As a result, leaders should ask themselves a range of critical questions relating

to the “new” nature of work in gen-AI-enabled organizations, including the following:

What are the organization-wide implications of gen AI? Rather than taking a passive

approach to identifying potential use cases and investments associated with gen AI, leaders

should view the situation through an “attacker’s lens.” They should consider all the primary,

secondary, and even tertiary effects of gen AI: Which business use cases are highest priority

now—and which might be candidates for gen AI enablement in six months, 12 months, and

so on? What changes will be required at a functional level to make gen AI enablement

possible—for instance, how many more software engineers will the company need? And as

gen AI functionality continues to be embedded in common word processing, email, and

communications tools (Microsoft’s 365 Copilot, for instance), what effect will that have on

ways of working across the entire organization? Could gen AI accelerate the shift to a four-

day work week? And even more broadly, how might entire industries or business models be

fundamentally disrupted?

Does the organization have the right technical talent and risk infrastructure in

place? Leaders should consider which operating-model designs will be most effective for

ensuring the long-term development of technology talent and the continued evolution of

gen AI applications in the organization (see sidebar “Speeding up the search for tech

talent”). They should also consider whether that same structure can satisfy the need for gen

AI oversight (see sidebar “A powerful resource with potential risks”).

How can corporate culture enable or inhibit the adoption and usage of gen AI? Gen AI

applications can be the catalyst for culture change—in more ways than one. The

applications themselves can create more organizational transparency and connectivity. One

company, for instance, is piloting a gen AI application that allows users to ask questions

about operations, sales, and other topics, and the tool draws from the company’s entire

collection of intellectual property to come up with answers that can guide users to the most

relevant experts and data. Employees report feeling better informed and more connected.

Additionally, the same cultural traits that have been crucial for organizational success during

recent economic and business upheavals—such as adaptability, speed, agility, trust,

integrity, learning and experimentation, innovation, and a willingness to change—will be

even more important if organizations want to become truly enabled by gen AI. To

understand why, consider the findings from the 2023 McKinsey Digital survey of 1,000

organizations, which found a significant synergy between organizations with strong,

innovative cultures and their ability to increase value through new digital technologies,

including gen AI.

[ 6 ]

 In previous iterations of that survey, respondents said the biggest

obstacle to their digital success was a culture that was averse to risk and experimentation.
[ 7 ]

How should organizations change their talent management approaches? Gen AI

applications will have unprecedented effects on organizations’ approaches to talent

management. Consider the inevitable impact of gen AI applications on apprenticeship,

particularly in the case of knowledge work: imagine a marketing leader uses a gen AI

application to write a creative brief that previously would have been developed by a more

junior marketing associate. What will happen to the development and mentorship

opportunities for both the leader and associate when the learning process is

disintermediated by gen AI? What’s more, both the content and the delivery of skill-building

programs will be affected. A chatbot could guide new employees through training on a new

technology, at their own pace, on their own terms, allowing them to increase the extent and

speed of their learning.

[ 8 ]

 Meanwhile, their instructor may use a gen-AI-enabled “teaching

assistant” app to create engaging training modules for individuals and groups and to track

the progress of both.

These are just a few key organizational considerations; many more are still evolving.

Decisions on structure and operating-model design, for instance, will vary from company to

company, but whatever the form, our  decades-long experience with digital

transformations  suggests that discussions about value creation must remain at the center.
[ 9 ]

 Work processes should enable short, quick cycles of experimentation and iteration and

high-quality feedback loops among employees, leaders, and the gen AI applications

themselves. To that end, it can be helpful to build small cross-functional teams working end

to end on projects and initiatives.

People and gen AI: Building an empowered
workforce

Gen AI can be a powerful tool for employee empowerment—even among those who initially

perceive it as a threat:

It can augment the employee experience. Gen AI applications can assist employees in

ways that many workers may not even expect. For instance, gen AI can suggest the new

lines of code required to update a financial-reporting system or outline the A and B versions

of a marketing campaign or otherwise create first drafts that human employees can take

and implement in live production environments. And by facilitating the training and

upskilling process, gen AI applications can help employees pick up new skills more quickly.

A recent study, for instance, found that software engineers completed their coding tasks up

to twice as fast when using gen AI and reported more satisfaction with the process.

[ 10 ]

It can empower middle managers. The benefits of gen AI can accrue not just to frontline

workers but also to middle managers. In fact, as the people closest to employees, middle

managers have a critical role to play in increasing employees’ comfort with both short-term

gen-AI-enabled work and long-term collaborations with the technology.

[ 11 ]

 And as their own

direct reports learn to work with gen AI, middle managers may find themselves overseeing

more and different kinds of work streams, moving at a pace never seen before. At the same

time, the use of gen AI can free up more capacity for middle managers, so they can shift

their attention to higher-value leadership tasks, such as strategy-focused work and people

management.

It can help organizations reinvent their talent management practices. The emergence of

gen AI presents an opportunity for organizations to hone their approaches to attracting,

retaining, and developing talent—particularly when it comes to creators and tech

professionals. HR professionals could use gen AI to send personalized outreach emails to

candidates and to design job search experiences for candidates in underrepresented

groups; research suggests this work could dramatically increase the number and diversity of

applications for various roles.

[ 12 ]

 Gen AI applications could also help companies match new

hires with mentors and coaches to improve the onboarding experience, upskill talent, and

streamline administrative tasks.

It can prompt senior leaders to lead differently. Senior leaders face the dual responsibility

of quickly implementing gen AI today and anticipating future versions of gen AI technologies

and their implications. More than anyone else in the organization, they will need to be

evangelists for gen AI, encouraging the development and adoption of the technology

organization wide. That will mean working with other business unit and technology leaders

to allocate resources to update technology infrastructure and take any interim process

steps required to facilitate the gen AI rollout—for instance, moving applications to private

cloud-hosted environments. In fact, a central task for senior leaders will be to find ways to

forge stronger connections between technology leaders and the business units. One

company, for example, launched a Slack channel devoted to ongoing discussion of gen AI

pilots. Through such forums, employees, product developers, and other business and

technology leaders can share stories about their experiences with gen AI, whether and how

their daily tasks have changed, and their thoughts on the gen AI journey so far.

As they would when introducing any new technology, senior leaders should speak clearly

about the business objectives of gen AI, communicating early and often about gen AI’s role

in “augmenting versus replacing” jobs. They should paint a compelling picture of how

various aspects of the organization will be rewired through gen AI—technically, financially,

culturally, and so on.

Of course, if senior leaders don’t understand the technology themselves, it will be more

difficult to make this case for, and lead their teams into, a gen-AI-enabled future. One way

for leaders to stay plugged in is to establish forums that provide ongoing professional

education on advances in AI technology and applications. Another approach is to carve out

time during planning meetings to consider forward-looking questions such as, “Is our

approach to gen AI today flexible enough to accommodate the next iteration, and the one

after that?” and “Which process steps or roles will we be able to reinvent with the next

iteration of gen AI?”

Although generative AI burst onto the scene seemingly overnight, CEOs and other business

leaders can ill afford to take an overly cautious approach to introducing it in their

organizations. If ever a business opportunity demanded a bias for action, this is it. By taking

the following three steps simultaneously, and with a sense of urgency, leaders can do more

than just “keep up”—they can capture early gains and stay ahead of competitors.

Demystify gen AI for everyone. Senior leaders themselves should develop a deep

understanding of gen AI and associated capabilities themselves so they can help to

demystify the technology for the rest of the organization. They can then help to introduce

mechanisms for managing uncertainties about gen AI where they exist—for instance,

establishing clear guidance regarding the use of gen AI tools in hiring and recruiting where

AI model biases could emerge.

Identify two or three high-impact use cases—and just get started. Senior leaders should

carefully consider their investments in gen AI pilots, and “go big” on those that show the

greatest promise of scalability and long-term value—whether it’s an application that

simplifies financial reporting or one that enhances onboarding for new hires. As part of this

vetting process, senior leaders should consider the business or industry risks or

opportunities associated with implementing the gen AI pilot, as well as how hard or easy it

will be to move the pilot into production and make it a part of employees’ day-to-day

experiences. Once that vetting has happened, senior leaders should steer resources

accordingly and take care to monitor and measure the outputs from gen AI initiatives and

pilots. Remember, some gen AI initiatives may show impact in the next 12 months, while

others may require investment now to yield results in two to five years. The longer-term

goal, then, should be to set up a sustainable engine for the rapid upskilling of employees

and scaling of gen AI and other digital capabilities.

Commit to building the necessary roles, skills, and capabilities—now and in the

future. Senior leaders should commit to building employees’ gen AI skills so they can use

the technology judiciously and successfully in their day-to-day work. It’s not a one-and-

done process; leaders will need to continually assess how and when tasks are performed,

who is performing them, how long tasks typically take, and how critical different tasks are.

Through this process, leaders can better understand current and future talent needs and

determine how best to redeploy and upskill talent. Indeed, upskilling programs will take on

greater importance than ever, as employees will need to learn to manage and work with gen

AI tools that are themselves ever evolving. Leaders should also keep in mind that gen AI

itself may facilitate the creation of content for, and automated or personalized delivery of,

such upskilling programs.

In the time it took to read this article, gen AI applications have already gotten that much

smarter. Leaders can put that intelligence to good use. It’s clear that much of the value of

gen AI will come from tailoring it to organization-specific use cases—but the successful

integration of gen AI requires experimentation and iteration. There is no time to sit back and

learn from others’ mistakes. Invest deliberately. Get your hands dirty. Start now.
