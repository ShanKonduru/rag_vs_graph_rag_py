Week 8: Blockchain, NFTs, AR/VR, Metaverse and Cryptocurrency 

ISB CTO 

Video 1: Blockchain: Applications and Use Cases 

Let us now talk about IoT, Web 3.0, Blockchain and NFT. These are all related things. 
They are not only disrupting industries, they are creating interesting business solutions 
and all businesses have to look at them from little different perspective. It is a learning 
for everybody. So, why all the companies are rushing towards that? 

So, let us start with blockchain. Now, when we think about blockchain, blockchain and 
IoT go hand to hand because blockchain requires that all the data which is recorded 
from the source rather than somebody inputting the data. Now, if it is recorded from the 
source, that means that we need lot of sensors for that, lot of connectivity for that. So, 
they are creating lot of connectivity. They are generating data from that, which is very 
important. One of the key features of blockchain is that the data cannot be reversed. 

That is an interesting one that even though we could have logged the databases in the 
past, somebody could go and edit it and sometimes the logs are not very clear. So, this 
blockchain requires that you cannot reverse a record. Now that is a big feature and one 
of the most important features of blockchain  that makes it very secured and have lots 
of use cases around that. When we think of things like blockchain, they are not really 
using something that we have not seen. They have different pieces which we know, like 
for  example,  they  have  a  database  features  which  is  good.  They  have  a  distributed 
features. Maybe we have not seen distributed features ' that the whole data is storing 
at different places, but that is still can be, could have been done. Now blockchain real 
action, of course, happened when Bitcoin came around 2010. But the applications did 
not come until 2017-18 or even 2019 when we did not see the use cases. 

And use cases are not happening in different types of use cases. Some are very static 
kind of thing; some are more dynamic and interactive. But the biggest thing that we all 
have to understand is most of the applications of blockchain we have seen till now, it 
has been permissionless and public. When I say permissionless, which means anybody 
can join, read, write and connect and it has very low scalability because anybody can 
read,  write  and  join.  So,  it  is  very  hard  to  scale  it  up.  But  most  of  the  practical 
blockchains are not going to be permissionless, public blockchain. They are going to be 
permission, private blockchain, which means only authorised people can read and write 
and only the network operator can edit or can access some of the content. Very high 
scalability.  So,  we  have  to  think  from  that.  Many  times,  people  don't  differentiate 
between these two type of blockchain network. 

We see all the blockchain network from cryptocurrency and we think that is how it works. 
Whereas JP Morgan Chase is not going to build a blockchain or Novartis is not going 
to  build  a  blockchain  that  will  look  like  how cryptocurrencies  work.  They  will  be  very 
tightly  controlled.  And these  are  the  companies  who are  spending  lot of  money  right 
now on creating their own blockchain. Now, the important piece of blockchain is that 

 ISB CTO

since it is in a very early stage, sometimes people do not realise what it can do. And 
there was a study done where a lot of executives were asked that compared to Internet, 
which year are we in blockchain? So, if you take Internet years, which year are we in 
blockchain? Now, just to give you some perspective, in the case of Internet, we saw 
that World Wide Web came in early 90s, right?  World Wide Web came, then Amazon 
came around 94. Then we have Netflix came a few years later, right? So, where are we 
right  now  in  blockchain.  So,  what  we  are  really  seeing  is  that  very  simple  uses  of 
blockchain and very simple results. But once the things start moving to blockchain, it 
has the potential to do even more than what World Wide Web did to us. We all should 
ask, why should I implement blockchain? And that is a very good question to ask. We 
should not do it just because it is a good technology, it should solve some business 
problems for us. But we at the same time, we should be very forward-looking that how 
these blockchains can create new business opportunities. 

Once we have that, then we will be in very good shape. We have started seeing several 
use cases. One very interesting use case is the, in the diamond industry. So, diamond 
industry  and  almost  all  of  the  large  diamond  players  worldwide  are  moving  to 
blockchain. Now, think about why diamond industry? First of all, it gives the authenticity. 
Now, in diamond industry, by looking at the diamond, there are very few people who 
can tell the price. Very, very few people. And these days artificial diamond is as good 
as the real diamond or synthetic diamond. So, this basically guarantees the authenticity. 
Not only that, it simplifies the whole supply chain which make things better. So, we need 
to think about what could be similar products where it can be applied. 

That outlook and vision is extremely important. Another very good application is how 
Walmart have started doing for food supply chain. Now in the food supply chain, lot of 
things can happen. If you have blockchain, first of all, you can isolate all the different 
problems coming in the supply chain. You can just see where the problem is happening. 
If a spinach is bad, you can immediately isolate it and you can go to the source of the 
problem  and  fix  it  much,  much  faster  than  what  we  can  do  now.  But  it  also  create 
transparency during the supply chain and in the future, possibly customer can just scan 
a code and they can see the whole images and video of how processing was done. 
Now  that  power  blockchain  has,  and  as  I  told  earlier,  we  do  not  even  know  what 
business solutions or business models will come on top of it. 

Pharmacy is using it a lot. Lot of pharmacy stuff gone into that for two key purposes. 
One is to fight fraud and second, they can actually detect the temperature, pressure, 
humidity in real-time that go to blockchain. So, nobody can tamper with it, nobody can 
lie about it. For example, if you get a medicine and says that it should be kept at  -20 
degree,  how  do  you  know  it  was  always  kept  at  that?  So,  that  is another  very  good 
application.  Now  interestingly,  lot  of  government  agencies  started  implementing 
blockchain.  Dubai  claimed  to  be  the  first  country  to  move  all  of  their  government 
businesses  to  blockchain.  Georgia,  Georgia  country,  not  the  state  in  the  US,  they 
moved their land registry to blockchain, and they had a very top-down approach where 
it was told them to all the stakeholders that we are doing it, right? Because in Georgia 
because  of  the  corruption  and  other  things,  many  people  were  making  very  serious 
money in land registry. So, they would oppose it. They will say it is untested technology, 

 ISB CTO 

2  

 
   
  
  
so we should not do that. Interestingly in India, Telangana and Andhra, government, 
they have started blockchain for land registry. They have already started implementing. 
This will be a very good use case to see what really happens. But how we should look 
at blockchain would see is to understand that what kind of fitness problem it can solve 
in the short run and what kind of opportunities it can bring in the long run. If we are able 
to do that, I think we can do wonders with it. But it is very hard to imagine that 10 or 20 
years down the line that many, many systems will not be on the blockchain. So, it is 
going to happen. It is just the matter of time. 

Video 2: NFTs and Web 3.0 

And then, another technology that is working very closely with blockchain and actually 
it requires blockchain is the use of augmented, virtual and mixed reality and specially 
metaverse.  Metaverse  require  us  to  have  blockchain.  Now,  before  this  augmented, 
virtual and mixed reality and metaverse, we also need to understand this. There is a 
piece here in blockchain that lead us to the path of two things, one is NFTs, and one is 
Web 3.0. So, let us see how they are related.  

So, if you think of what was Web 1.0, Web 1.0 was the time when we started having 
worldwide web. And in that, most of the data were generated by businesses. They had 
their own website; they created their own pages and so on. But in 2000s, we started 
seeing lot of data being generated by users and we called it Web 2.0. It was all user 
generated content like in social media in reviews. What web 3.0 right now tells us is that 
all  the  data  that  is  being  generated  should  be  authentic.  It  should  be  owned  by  the 
creator  of  the  data.  The  problem  and  challenge  is  that  the  authenticity  is  lost  in  the 
process. Now, we don't have clear picture; what is correct, what is wrong? So, can we 
use  AI  and  machine  learning  to  fix  that?  Now,  problem  is  that  lot  of  non-authentic 
document  is  also  created  by  these  machines.  It's  a  kind  of  convoluted  problem,  but 
blockchain can solve a problem greatly. If we start putting more and more data on block 
chain, then authenticity part will not be as of a problem. So, that is why web 3.0 is one 
to take back what was lost in Web 2.0 and one of the key piece was authenticity.  

Second is ownership of the data. Right now, all these companies own customers data, 
but  how  can  customers  own  their  own  data?  So,  and  that  will  lead  to  lot  of  new 
businesses and even the current businesses have to reinvent how they operate. So, 
this  is  very  exciting  time.  And  then  comes  NFTs  non-fungible  tokens,  non-fungible 
tokens, you can say it is a fad, but it is certainly more than fad because companies are 
investing lot of money on that, right. So, how it creates value, it is little unclear, but we 
have  to  think  about  how  to  create  new  business  solutions  around  that.  That  is,  the 
mindset is really needed here. 

Video 3: Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Realities 

So, let us come back to now augmented, virtual and mixed reality and metaverse, which 
is  also  impacting  different  businesses  and  different  industry.  So,  if  you  think  about 
augmented reality or virtual reality, so virtual reality is fully activation. You just go, you 
put a headset, you go inside the game, and you are cut off from the physical world. In 
augmented reality, you have some mix. So, you put a glasses where you can interact 

 ISB CTO 

3  

 
   
  
  
with the server, but you can also see the user. Mixed reality is some mix of that where 
you  can  really  mix  these  two,  virtual  and  fixed  reality.  And  that  is  where  lot  of  the 
solutions  are  coming  right  now  in  mixed  reality  domain  because  that  gives  the 
immersive value to the consumer, or the user and it can also give very good result. 

Now  just  to  look  at  one  example.  In  the  VR  you  need  or  virtual  reality,  you  need  a 
headset  to  wear  it  right  and  the  headset  can  be  connected  to  computers  or  not 
connected  to  computers.  If  you  look  at  augmented  reality,  the  good  example  will  be 
Pokémon  Go,  where  million  of  people  were  running  to  catch  pokies  in  the  physical 
world, right? So, users can interact with the real world while digital content is added to 
it. They can catch their pokies on an intersection, which is the physical intersection, not 
virtual right? So, this also leads to lot of human machine collaboration actually because 
this is where the  human and machine  are  really  working  together.  Now  the  real part 
which is happening right now is mixed reality. Mixed reality can start with the real world, 
go to the virtual world or it can start with the virtual world and go to the real world. That 
is how Skype is used on Microsoft HoloLens. Both are interesting and can create lots 
and lots of business solution. 

So, let's think about how this is being used. So, there's a company called Magic Leap. 
What  they  do,  they  have  created  a  device  which  is  much  lighter  than  others.  They 
basically try to create a lot of business solutions like meeting room and so on. But they 
are not stopped to that. They have also collaborating now with Wayfair which is a very 
large  furniture  delivery  company  that  you  can  bring  those  furniture  and  put  in  your 
drawing room, the virtual furniture and you can sit on it and see how it feels, how it looks 
and then you decide to buy. Now lot of places people are trying to do that technique 
and that that's fantastic. You know if you are able to do that, that can create totally new 
thing. They can even customise your offices. So, you can say that I want offices with 
these features, they can do it there. 

Now, if you look at the use cases in the enterprise space, one of the industry which is 
using  metaverse  and  augmented  in  virtual  reality  in  general  is  health  care  industry 
because there are lot of things that you cannot do in physical world. So, they allow you 
to  do those  kind of things. Imagine a  surgeon  is doing  an operation  in  the  operating 
room and they can actually able to get all the information on the patient in the real time. 
Okay, through this virtual reality. Lot of virtual reality is used in spaces like Tele-ICU 
and all because there you have to be in a different environment to make the change 
happen. So, how does that happen that becomes important. And construction is another 
industry where it is a huge potential. Why? Because see a house is being built and you 
want to see before the house is built that I want to live in the house. Now you can live 
in that through virtual reality. You can also see different pieces of the material used in 
the foundation and so on. And see all of these applications eventually, where you are 
creating this kind of data and they will have to sit in the blockchain at the end of the day 
because you want authenticity and you do not want them to be deleted and so on. So, 
all  of  these  things  come  together.  These  are  the  use  in  the  enterprise  space  for 
augmented reality, virtual reality but they are closely, closely related to blockchain kind 
of solution. So, we have to look at it in the holistic manner, all these strains. We can just 

 ISB CTO 

4  

 
   
  
  
look at them separately and make a decision. Why do not you go and watch this video 
and come back and then I will discuss about it. 

So, you saw in this video that how the VR was used in physiotherapy. This person could 
do whatever they want, and this is physiotherapy. Now these are the kind of innovative 
solutions I am talking about because we can do lot of stuff. We have worked on a project 
where a psychiatrist in the real time can examine the brain wave of the patients. So, 
how  it  works  is  that  patient  has  to  wear  a  small  device  and  on  the  screen  of  the 
psychiatrist,  you  can  see  in  the  real  time  how  when  they  give  some  message  or 
command or say something, how the brain waves move in the person's head, and they 
can  then  customise  their  reaction  based  on  that.  One  of  the  thing  that  is  becoming 
extremely common now is that how I can do mass customisation. Mass customisation 
means is that I can serve lot of people but customise for each of them, do not give a 
bundle product to them and that will change or create lot of businesses. Another very 
interesting  solution  that  is  coming  from  virtual  reality  is  the  future  of  work  because 
people may not want to go to offices, many of them. So, how I can create a future of 
work where it looks realistic enough, that is the important part realistic enough, so that 
people can say that yes, it makes sense.  

Video 4: Metaverse 

Now,  if  you  look  at  the  bigger  applications  of  all  those  things,  then  we  get  into 
Metaverse.  Now,  Metaverse  suddenly  became  very  popular  when  Mark  Zuckerberg 
decided to change the name of his company to Meta. And why they did it? Because 
their goal was to go big full flow in that, and lot of things is happening since then. Lot of 
people are getting into metaverse and doing things.  

But what businesses are doing? Businesses are taking very interesting approach. So, 
think of companies like Nike and Adidas. Nike decided that they will go full flow into this 
metaverse  thing  and  when  we  say  that  we  will  go  full  flow  means  they  have  started 
creating in the metaverse, they have first become part of very cutting or very modern 
groups, so it is very appealing to the new generation. But then in that metaverse, they 
have started creating digital goods of shoes. Now, that is very interesting for both Nike 
and Adidas. Now, you create a digital copy of the shoe and how you can promote now? 
You can say that, well I have a digital copy, why do not you keep a digital copy and 
physical copy bundle. So, they can do up-selling and cross-selling. Now, in the physical 
world  your  shoes  are  getting  bad,  in  the  digital  world  they  do  not  have  to  go  bad, 
because  they  are  one  zeros.  But  to  emulate  they  may  sometimes  write  the  code  to 
make your shoes bad, so that they look similar, and it increases customer experience 
as well. So, there are lot of such interesting things happening right now that we all need 
to look at, consider it and see what happens. How to deal with this whole metaverse 
and NFT thing will certainly change lot of businesses. So, we all have to be looking at 
it very carefully. 

But another interesting thing happened is that there is a big land boom has started in 
metaverse. So, lot of accounting firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers, they have bought 
virtual land in metaverse; and they are spending lots and lots of money in there. So, 
why are they doing that? So, understand the basic concept here, then we will go to the 

 ISB CTO 

5  

 
   
  
  
business side of it. So, this metaverse is created by some company. So, they created 
this company, and they decided the land parcels like a physical world. They can create 
any land as they want, but they have to create scarcity. And while somebody buy this 
land, they can create office, they can create a mall, they can create a food store and 
you  can  provide  services  also  where  the  real  people  will  go,  but  the  avatars  will  be 
interacting,  but  the  real  people  will  be  there  interacting.  So,  lot  of  financial  advice  is 
happening,  now  lot  of  concerts  are  happening  in  there  as  well.  The  real  concert  is 
playing, but you see them in the metaverse. So, for businesses it is a pretty fantastic 
thing. Just think about you know, a question of how much land to buy and how risky it 
is, that creates lot of interesting questions right there. 

Now, one area in metaverse that is happening right now is fashion industry. So, fashion 
industry, they are creating clothes, one for your own self and one for your digital avatar. 
And they can create a mixed strategy for you where you have similar clothes for you 
can have a different clothes. So, fashion industry is investing a lot and they use lot of 
data and analytics to make this happen, but they are not the only one. Walmart has 
invested  a  lot  in metaverse.  And  they have even  started  having  some  NFTs or non-
fungible token using the Walmart. All of this technology that we are seeing here, they 
have to use blockchain; and this blockchain will be basis of all the metaverse and NFTs. 
So, it will be quite interesting, but it goes.  

Walmart actually have now launched their own position in the metaverse; and they are 
trying to say that they can sell items, they can interact with customers and so on. It will 
be quite interesting. In Indian context, actually, Flipkart tried with Metaverse. They did 
give  it  a  try  first  time  in  the  Diwali  time  during  2022,  when  they  opened  this  as  an 
experiment.  It  was  not  a  great  experience  for  consumers,  but  it  shows  that  it  is 
everywhere,  and  customers  are  looking  at  it.  So,  how  would  it  impact  and  change 
businesses? How would it create new businesses? 

And you can eventually sell anything in metaverse right now if you really think, because 
if so many people are there, they need to buy item. And some of the companies in India 
like  Aditya  Birla  Group  and  many  other  companies,  they  are  already  experimenting. 
They have even done some of the solutions in metaverse, they have done some events 
in the metaverse. So, clearly they see the real value and path in that. So, it is yet to be 
seen what really happens, but for all of us it is important to see that how it all fits into 
one place. 

Now, as I told you the metaverse one piece, people do they create NFTs. Now, non-
fungible token just in a simple manner is something that is digital good, but it is owned 
by only one person at a time. If you look at the examples of NFT; and all of these NFTs 
have to go on blockchain. A lot of meta verse items are NFTs like shoes of Adidas in 
metaverse released in NFT, even GAP release some of their hoodies as NFTs in the 
metaverse.  So,  NFTs  are  another  thing  that  connects  all  these  pieces  of  the  puzzle 
together. 

They have to move together, otherwise nothing will work. Melania Trump for example 
started a new line of these NFTs, where she started with the picture of her eye and so 
on. But interestingly in Florida, one house was sold on NFT, physical house. Now, what 

 ISB CTO 

6  

 
   
  
  
does  that  mean?  What  is  the  meaning  of  even  selling  the  house  on  NFT?  See,  this 
really means is that all the data that has been created is going on blockchain. That is 
the  key  idea  there,  but  nothing  much.  It  is  a  physical  thing,  but  the  lines  are  getting 
blurred. And why people would buy digital goods? Like if you go to metaverse, you have 
to drink beer, your avatar has to drink beer, you have to pay money for that, and people 
are making money on that. So, why is that happening? It is mainly, because the newer 
generation people are going to metaverse, and businesses are realising they are the 
future customers. So, if they do not move fast it will be a problem.  

Now, when you think about metaverse, you will require blockchain, you will require non-
fungible  tokens  or  NFT,  and  lots  and  lots  of  AI,  machine  learning,  and  possibly 
generative AI to see what kind of different options be created there. So, these all trades 
fit  together,  which  is  what  makes  it  amazing.  And  because  of  that,  it  is  very  much 
possible that we come up with the solutions that we cannot even think. I am sure that 
there  will  be  solutions.  So,  those  companies  who  can  initially  start  looking  at  it,  can 
create some solutions, business solutions, they will be the winner in the game. So, it 
does not mean you have to implement it right now. It simply means that you have to 
start looking at it. You have to look at your pain points and see how they can solve. You 
also  have  to  see  what  could  be  the  future  pain  points,  how  to  create  a  competitive 
advantage. All of that need to be done to be successful in this domain. And that will 
basically create the whole new industry here.  

So, now if we go further into this, NFT. NFT itself is quite interesting. All of these brings 
us to Web 3.0. Web 3.0 says that you need to have authentic data, you need to have 
decentralised web and the owner of the creator of the data should own the data. So, 
we will see how far we get into that. But this is something that we need to be watchful 
of  as  businesses.  And  in  the  very  little  time  already,  lots  and  lots  of  use  cases  are 
coming that makes it exciting. 

Video 5: Virtual Assistants and Chatbots 

Now, another piece which is important in this whole puzzle is about virtual assistants 
and chat. That has already started  revolutionising industries, and that is where lot of 
rules and regulations also play an important role. So, let us try to understand why we 
are  talking  about  it,  what  we  have  and  what  we  need  to  worry  about.  So,  think  of  a 
simple chatbot, and I will give you one example which Microsoft has demonstrated that, 
let's say, that you go to a meeting and there are two human in the meeting first, but they 
say that let's order a coffee. So, they go to a bot, Cortana bot or Microsoft bot and say, 
"Can you order coffee for us?" Now that bot is start talking to the bot of the office store. 
So,  these two  bots  are  talking,  and  they  are  deciding  what  to  order, where  to  order. 
They also connect it to your address, so they also get Google map. They also connect 
it to your payment system. But the interesting part is that the human can also participate 
in that. Now, this is where the boundaries start getting blurry and things start getting 
interesting. 

Many such solutions are emerging, and we will see in near future what kind of solutions 
are coming. So, you know chatbots, what we said they are basically using some kind of 
human  language  to  communicate,  but  using  AI.  That  is  the  idea  here  and  they  use 

 ISB CTO 

7  

 
   
  
  
machine learning, they use natural language processing, NLP, which we done. But they 
also  does  natural  language  understanding,  which  is  NLU  and  natural  language 
generation. Now natural language generation part, generative AI can play an extremely 
important role. You know they can totally change the way we do things. And it has a 
potential to not only generate content, but also modify or refine it. I was just talking to 
one  company  and  they  told  that  they  had  written  some  AI  based  solutions  and  in 
healthcare  domain  and  the  doctors  did  not  like  it.  So,  now  they  are  going  and  re 
experimenting that these were the suggestions given to doctors. So, what about they 
did not like it because it was not written back. So, they say what about we give it to 
generative AI and ask them exactly what kind of improvement is needed, rewrite it and 
go back to them, right. That is the kind of things we are talking here. If you combine all 
of this AI with generative AI, with blockchain, with NFT and chatbots, I think there is a 
huge potential there. 

Some  of  the  bot  examples  like  in  India,  HDFC  Bank  has  a  virtual assistant  but  very 
basic though. Now chatbot has very similar problem what we saw with Internet right. 
So, there is an interesting story. In 1995, Bill Gates was giving an interview in a late-
night  show  with  David  Letterman.  And  David  Letterman  basically  asked  him,  "What, 
what do we hear about Internet?" What is this Internet? So, Bill Gates tried to explain 
that go you can watch a baseball game. And Littleman says that "Oh, I can do that in 
my radio." I say, no, no, but you can record it all. I can do it in my tape recorder. Then 
Bill Gates says but you can search things that you cannot find. Littleman told, "I could 
find anything. I could subscribe to this. I could subscribe to this." So, even Bill Gates 
was  not  really  able  to  explain  that  where  the  values  because  we  had  not  seen  it, 
visionary person like this had also not seen it. So, do not expect that with chatbots and 
blockchain, we are going to see the solutions right away. But we have to be proactive 
and keep looking at things then only we will make a dent there. That is the key part 
here. 

Video 6: Chatbots: Applications and Examples 

Some of  the  interesting  examples  of  chatbots,  the  popular  ones are  of  course  Alexa 
and  Siri  and  so  on.  We  all  know  that.  But  Microsoft  is  carrying  out  a  massive  social 
experiment  in  China,  and  that  experiment  is  called  Xiaoice.  Xiaoice  is  a  called  a 
conversational  chatbot.  The  chatbot  which  talks  to  human.  It  is  used  by  millions  of 
people every day. It can respond with humanlike answers. You can even think if you 
send a picture of your broken ankle, Xiaoice will say oh, is it hurting?  So, converting 
that part right see the broken ankle is converted into whether it is hurting that is the key 
part. And if something see does not know much about we will try to cover it. That is also 
very important and interesting. If that does not work, sometimes Xiaoice can even be 
embarrassed like human world. Millions of Chinese users were telling that they loved it 
and  many  of  them  have  told  I  love  you  while  using  it.  So,  this  shows  the  power  of 
conversational  bot.  Lot  of  businesses  are  coming  in  there  Actually  Xiaoice  was 
launched in India also as RUUH which has been discontinued now because Microsoft 
is trying to consolidate their things but clearly it creates new business solution.

Domino's is using for ordering and many other things. That's a very good use case. But 
internally in businesses, chatbots are now being used a lot. 

So, within a business we usually have lot of knowledge but how to share knowledge? 
Can we use a bot which can search this knowledge for us by connecting to different 
databases?  That  will  be  fantastic.  And  then  connect  it  with  generative  AI  which  can 
even generate content for us. That's where the value will come. Another very interesting 
example was when Georgia Tech professor hired a TA named Jill Watson to help with 
the  course.  And throughout  the  course,  Jill Watson answered questions  for students 
and reduce the workload for the professor. But in fact, Jill Watson was AI bot and the 
professor Ashok Goel, he disclosed it to the students only at the end of the semester 
and the students were surprised. Some told that we were going to nominate Harper as 
the best. So, that is the one side where we see lot of help right in meeting organisation 
or doing things for us,  ordering  coffee  for us  and  so on. And that will  get  better and 
better with time.  

Another layer of the ChatGPT is getting into the conversational side. So, in fact, lot of 
bots are coming, which are referred to as immortality bot. What it means is that if you 
buy that bot, then the bot can do things for you even when you are dead. This is a little 
bit dark side, but one of the early company was started by a person who told I am going 
to disrupt the industry of death when people are subscribing to it. But look at the power 
of data now. it can take all your social media data and c text or even text messages or 
social  media  messages  on  your  behalf.  Now  a  lot  of  good  business  applications 
certainly are around there, but clearly this has sort of potential and value to make things 
happen. Now at the broad level, chatbots essentially just take the data, do the natural 
language processing, connect with lot of data sources and return the result.  

So, we will take a pause and ask you to watch this video and come back and here you 
will  see  what  kind  of  solutions  can  be  created.  So,  you  saw  that  this  was  fantastic 
application of how the chatbots can really change the way we think. And so, these kind 
of solutions are going to create lot of business value. But one of the challenge that is 
happening right now is that one side is the ethical side. So, if a customer is interacting 
with the chatbot, should the company declare that it is a chatbot? That is very ethical 
question to ask, right. Now some customers may prefer to know that I am talking to a 
chatbot. Some customers say that I do not care. Also, should you give character to your 
chatbot  or your chatbot  should  look  like  a machine.  Some  customers will  prefer that 
chatbot  looks  like a machine.  I  know clearly it  is a machine.  It  is not a human  being 
rather than acting like a human being. But these questions depend on the industry. This 
also depends on your applications and your customer base because that then only you 
can do.  

The second piece comes that how much of it should be regulated. I can give you one 
example. I give you the example of Xiaoice right. When Xiaoice was launched in China 
and it did very good, the Microsoft launched a similar product in US called Tay and Tay 
was  the  same  thing,  conversational  bot.  You  can  talk  to  them;  you  can  ask  them  to 
answer some questions for you or even have jokes around that. But Tay was taught to 
use slur languages and the languages which are not appropriate to certain ethnicity.

They had to take it down. But should government intervene in this kind of situations and 
create a policy around that? That is a very good question and that is where all the data 
laws and all becomes very important.  

Video 7: Industry 4.0 and 5.0 

In the industry trend, we talk about AI, machine learning, deep learning and we also talk 
about then Generative AI. And then, closely related pieces are Blockchain, Web 3.0, 
NFT's and all the uses of them in different industry. And all of these things are creating 
lot of data, creating lot of connectivity. Now, one of the closely related concept to all of 
this is what role does industry 5.0 and cyber security plays into that, and this is where 
the regulations become very important as well. So, let us first  understand what really 
Industry  5.0  or  what  Industry 4.0  is    and  then  how  does  it  impact  the  cyber  security 
concept. 

So,  Industry  4.0  was  the  name  given  to  the  current  trend  of  automation  and  data 
exchange, especially in manufacturing technologies, and it included the cyber physical 
system,  which  means  it  has  IoT,  which  means  all  the  pieces  are  connected  to  each 
other.  Cloud  computing,  so  you  will  do  it  in  the  cloud  and  cognitive  computing, 
understanding  the  brain  part.  And  it  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the  fourth  Industrial 
Revolution.  And  if  we  look  at  different  disruptions  which  made  this  happen,  one 
disruption is because we have lot of data, rising volume of data that has led us to go to 
Industry 4.0.  Also,  the  emergence  of  analytics  and business  intelligence  capabilities, 
that is also making this happen because now we have newer methods like generative 
AI that we did not have earlier, and this creates lot of human machine collaboration and 
these capabilities are also causing disruption. 

Another piece that is causing lot of disruption is augmented, virtual and mixed reality, 
things  like  Metaverse.  And  then  comes  that  piece  of  advanced  robotics,  your  3D 
printing, these kind of things in the physical world are making big difference. So, mix of 
this physical or cyber physical world, it is making this happen. And why we call it Industry 
4.0? Because we started with LEAN revolution, that was the first one, where we did lot 
of mechanisation, water power, steam power. Then, we started with mass production, 
assembly  line  electricity,  that  was  the  Industry  2.0.  Then  came  Industry  3.0  with 
computer and automation. 

And where the Industry 4.0 comes is the lot of cyber physical system. So, this machine 
and human are working together. But we have not stopped just with that, we are moving 
to  Industry  5.0.  But  before  getting  into  Industry  5.0,  let  us  first  make  sure  we  all 
understand that what are the use cases. So, Industry 4.0 fosters what has been called 
a smart factory. And they try to create, how can we create cyber physical system that 
can monitor physical processes. I can give you several examples of that. So, in the old 
world  or  in  the  traditional  manufacturing,  the  part  is  produced  and  then  we  do  the 
sampling of the part. So, we take some sample of the parts, and we do some statistical 
testing to see whether this lot was good or not. 

And if the lot was bad, then we discard the whole lot and go back and stop the machine 
which  is  creating  much  product  even  after  we  started  the  testing,  very  expensive

process. Now for many of the processes, we have implemented... when I say we, I have 
worked with a company very closely, started by one of my students. And I will talk about 
that  company a  little  bit  more  later, it  is called  Insightzz  We  have worked  with  many 
manufacturers in  India  where  we put a  camera,  which  in  real-time  looks  at,  take  the 
video of the part which is being produced and in the real-time tells that "Oh, this part is 
bad." And you stop the machine right there. 

No sampling and 100% data checking. Each part is being checked and it is corrected 
or at least stopped right then without wasting any lot. Correction part has to be still done 
by somebody, but it identifies, detects right in the real-time. This is, I am talking cyber 
physical systems monitor physical processes; lot of such solutions are coming. These 
are  all  cutting  edge,  this  is  happening  right  now,  but  many  such  things  will  happen. 
Create a virtual copy of the physical world which we call digital twin. So, in the digital 
twin essentially, I want to make sure that I can work efficiently by having all the virtual 
copy and make lot of decentralised decisions where, you know, you create lot of small, 
small modules which can do their task and this modules can be reusable, and we can 
use lot of analytics and data there. 

So, all of these things happen over IoT because things have to talk to each other. So, 
understand  that  in  IoT.  And  to  give  a  brief  history  of  IoT,  IoT  essentially  started  at 
Procter and Gamble and there basically, the manager was not able to find some of the 
lipstick  part  or  at  least,  you  know,  that's  where  we  know  that  got  popular,  and  then 
started  connecting  pieces  together  using  RFID  tags  and  so  on.  So,  IoT  mainly  talks 
about  connecting  different  pieces  together.  So,  cyber  physical  system  communicate 
and cooperate with each other and with human in real-time, both internally and across 
organisations. 

So,  lot  of  Industry  4.0  has  led  that  to  happen.  And  as  I  talked  about  the  company 
Insightzz, which is typed as insight z, z. They, there if you go to website you can find 
lots of interesting solutions that has been done, lot of videos are there, you can watch. 
But  that  shows  how  all  these  different  pieces  of  current  trends  in  industry  is  being 
combined. But the challenge here  is that lot of these are designed for manufacturing 
companies, but they are not consistently aware of engineering technology. So, we have 
to make sure that awareness comes first and then the next push is towards Industry 
5.0. So, what is new in Industry 5.0? 

One of the biggest piece in Industry 5.0 is mass customisation. Personalised treatment 
for every cancer patient, that is a mass customisation. So, I am not going to give any 
fixed  doses  to  people.  So,  we  are  working  with  MIT  AI  team  and  also  the  biology 
department and my centre, we are working with the hospitals in India, we are, we are 
working with several hospitals in US, and we are trying to see, can we create a system 
where we can have mass customisation for cancer patient with personalised treatment? 
And how it will be different in different countries, that is the critical part here. So, if this 
truly happens, we really have Industry 5.0 in the real sense. In order for this to happen, 
we need a series of things. We need blockchain, that's very important. We need mixed 
reality,  that's  very  important.  We  need  drone,  lot  of  drone  system  and  additive 
technology.

Video 8: Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing 

Additive technology are technology which is like 3D printing, where they do layer-by-
layer, where these things are being used. Now, this industry 5.0 has traversed across, 
if  you  look  examples  in  India,  Indian  railway  has  invested  a  lot  of  money  on 
revolutionising and using industry 4.0 and industry 5.0. That's the one place, and that 
can have a lot of future potential because this can really change lot of things. But it has 
gone in healthcare, pharmaceutical, mining, mining is using that a lot as well, and that 
is because 3D printing is growing at the same time. So, 3D printing, why is it becoming 
so popular? 

There  are  two  key  reasons  for that. One  is that  some  of  the parts that  we  could not 
produce earlier, like NASA, Boeing or even in healthcare, we are able to produce now 
with 3D printing. But second, 3D printing help us in reducing lot of supply chain cost 
and  one  classic  example  in  the  recent  days  have  been,  so  the  spare  parts  in  any 
industry have lot of variability in demand because there are many spare parts and which 
part is being demanded is not clear. 

So,  what  the  companies  do?  They  keep  lot  of  different  copies  of  spare  parts  which 
increases the supply chain costs, and the cost is so high that it is better for me, or it is 
beneficial for me to just do the 3D printing for them. So, many of the 3D printing solutions 
are  coming  to  reduce  supply  chain  cost,  not  just  because  of  the  complexity  of  the 
product or just because we could not produce it. So, going, looking at the history of 3D 
printing, uh, you know, the first patent was granted in 1986 and, uh, that's when the 
action started. But as happens with any technology, we did not see too much happening 
early on but still some of the DIY part, do-it-yourself part, started coming. People started 
printing 3D working kidney and also they, you know, even self-replicating printer was 
also printed.  

Prosthetics, major breakthrough was done around 2008-09, where they could do like 
prosthetics using 3D printer. They started making blood vessels also in late 2009. In 
2010s, a car was built in 3D printing, jaw implants were done in 3D printing, uh, and it 
goes on. So, if you look at the applications of 3D printing and a lot of services go around 
there. But the key industry is aerospace, consumer industry, healthcare industry and 
manufacturing industry. 

These are the ones where the potential is the highest. Now, the limitations right now is 
mainly with materials and structural integrity, uh, of very different parts. So, you know, 
the  material  is  very  expensive,  so  that  creates  lot  of  challenge  and  there  is  a  lot  of 
research going on and whether this is good enough or not right. Now, if you look at the 
aerospace, in fact, Boeing and NASA, they all had a problem that some of the parts 
they  just  could not manufacture  or they  could manufacture,  they  could  not  ship from 
one  place  to  the  other.  NASA  is  using  lot  of  3D  parts  for  their  engines  and  satellite. 
Airbus has also announced that they are doing lot of 3D printing. Now there are more 
than half a million 3D printed dental implants and that number keep growing. Various 
organisations  are  researching,  uh,  the  possibility  of  bio  printing  life  cells  and  tissue. 
University  of  Toronto  has  been  ahead  in  the  game  and  this  and  McGill  and  both  in 
Canada. They are doing not only on 3D printing machines but also on the material used 

 ISB CTO

in 3D printing and which can allow lot of hollow parts which are hard to do. They are 
also, uh, creating models of human parts from CT scan or MRI image to assist surgeons 
during complex surgeries. 

So, lot of very interesting solutions, but the path towards commercialisation especially 
for health industry is very complex because you have to show that it can be used. So, 
the  challenge  has  not  been  in  making  good  parts,  challenge  has  been  how  to 
commercialise  it,  right.  So,  that  has  been  the  real  challenge  and  some  applications 
required  lot  of  funding  which  is  happening  now.  So,  recently  there  have  been  some 
good push on this. Various reports are predicting that 3D printing will experience the 
biggest growth in the consumer market in near future. And maybe what we need in the 
consumer market is a killer app like Uberisation, that there is an app which can connect 
those who need it, it can connect those who have the 3D printer and make the job done. 

And I think it will happen. We are almost getting there that we will start seeing lot of 3D 
printed  components  going  around  either  for  the  cost  purpose,  uh,  supply  chain  cost 
purpose or the design perspective. And as I told research is not only about printers but 
also about the material, how we can use cheaper material to make that happen. McGill 
is doing lot of work on health 3D printing but one of the most interesting example is that 
in Austin company called ICON has built a 3D printed house in less than 24 hours and 
it is approved house, livable house. And they are using this model to build houses in 
low-income countries where it is hard or lot of people don't have houses. So, you can 
have all these kind of solutions coming, and you will see that lot of action coming around 
that.
