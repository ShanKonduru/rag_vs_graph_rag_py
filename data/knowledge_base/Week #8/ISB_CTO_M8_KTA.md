Week 8: Blockchain, NFTs, AR/VR, Metaverse & Cryptocurrency 

Video 1: Blockchain: Applications and Use Cases 

•  The IoT, Web 3.0, Blockchain, and NFTs are interconnected technologies with significant 

disruptive potential in various industries. 

•  Blockchain, in particular, is closely linked with IoT as it requires data to be recorded directly 

from the source, necessitating extensive sensor networks and connectivity. 

•  The immutability of blockchain data sets it apart, ensuring that records cannot be reversed, 

offering enhanced security and numerous use cases. 

•  Blockchain use cases vary, encompassing both static and dynamic scenarios, but many initial 

applications have been permissionless and public, leading to scalability challenges. 
•  Practical blockchains are shifting towards permissioned, private networks with restricted 

access for increased scalability and control. 

•  The future of blockchain holds great promise, and businesses should evaluate its fitness for 

addressing current challenges while anticipating long-term opportunities. 

Video 2: NFTs and Web 3.0 

•  Blockchain serves as a bridge to two major technological advancements: Non-Fungible 

Tokens (NFTs) and Web 3.0. 

•  Web 1.0 marked the advent of the internet, largely driven by businesses generating content 

on their websites. 

•  Web 2.0, emerging in the 2000s, shifted the focus to user-generated content, such as social 

media and user reviews. 

•  Web 3.0 introduces the need for authenticity and data ownership in the digital realm, 

addressing challenges arising from an increasingly complex landscape of discerning genuine 
content from fabricated or manipulated data. 

•  The application of AI and machine learning to tackle authenticity issues presents challenges, 

including the creation of non-authentic content. 

•  Blockchain technology plays a vital role by anchoring data, mitigating authenticity concerns, 

and facilitating data ownership, making it a crucial component of Web 3.0. 

•  Web 3.0's emphasis on authenticity and data ownership necessitates businesses to 
reevaluate their operations and provides opportunities for innovative ventures. 

•  NFTs, while sometimes seen as a trend, attract significant investments, compelling a shift in 

mindset to explore novel business solutions within the NFT ecosystem. 

Video 3: Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Realities 

•  Augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR, VR, and MR) technologies are significantly 

impacting various industries and the emerging metaverse. 

•  VR immerses users in a fully digital environment through headsets, while AR blends the real 

and digital worlds, allowing interaction with both. 

•  MR combines VR and AR, offering immersive experiences and solutions in various domains. 
•  Blockchain integration becomes crucial for these applications to ensure data authenticity and 

permanence. 

•  The integration of AR, VR, MR, and blockchain forms a holistic technological ecosystem that 

reshapes industries and work environments. 

•  Mass customisation is on the rise, tailoring products and services to individual preferences. 
•  The future of work is undergoing a transformation, with realistic virtual environments 
redefining traditional office spaces to accommodate changing workforce needs.

Video 4: Metaverse 

•  Businesses are entering the metaverse by creating digital goods for consumer interaction. 
•  Companies like Nike and Adidas are exploring digital-physical bundle strategies for their 

products. 

•  Virtual land has become a valuable asset in the metaverse, with firms like 

PricewaterhouseCoopers investing in virtual land. 

•  The fashion industry is actively investing in the metaverse, creating clothes for both 

individuals and their digital avatars. 

•  Walmart and Flipkart are among the companies venturing into the metaverse, exploring its 

potential for selling products and services. 

•  NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) play a crucial role in the metaverse, representing ownership of 

digital goods, and are linked to blockchain technology. 

•  Businesses recognise the importance of appealing to the newer generation of consumers in 

the metaverse, prompting their quick adaptation. 

•  Web 3.0 emphasises authentic, decentralised data ownership, presenting exciting possibilities 

for future business solutions. 

Video 5: Virtual Assistants and Chatbots: Introduction 

•  The integration of virtual assistants and chatbots involves complex regulations and 

challenges. 

•  These AI interactions blur the lines between humans and bots, raising intriguing questions. 
•  AI technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding 

(NLU), and natural language generation (NLG) power chatbots. 

•  Generative AI, especially in NLG, can refine and modify content, significantly enhancing AI 

capabilities. 

•  Chatbots' value may not be immediately apparent, akin to the early days of the Internet. 
•  Staying proactive and vigilant is crucial in exploring and harnessing these transformative 

technologies. 

Video 6: Chatbots: Applications and Examples 

•  Microsoft's Xiaoice is a groundbreaking conversational chatbot used by millions in China and 

previously in India as RUUH. 

•  The integration of chatbots with generative AI promises significant value, enabling content 

generation. 

•  Emerging "immortality bots" can continue to represent individuals even after their demise, 

leveraging social media data. 

•  Ethical concerns surround chatbots, including whether companies should declare their use 

and the character they should adopt. 

•  Regulation questions arise prompting discussions on government intervention and data laws. 

Video 7: Industry 4.0 and 5.0 

• 

Industry 4.0 represents automation and data exchange, including IoT, cloud computing, and 
cognitive computing, forming the fourth Industrial Revolution. 

•  Disruptions leading to Industry 4.0 include data growth, analytics, human-machine 

collaboration, augmented reality, advanced robotics, and 3D printing. 

•  The transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 brings mass customisation, particularly in 

personalised cancer treatments. 

•  Enabling technologies for Industry 5.0 include blockchain, mixed reality, drones, and additive 

• 

technology. 
Industry 4.0 involves smart factories and cyber-physical systems for real-time monitoring, 
reducing costly sampling processes.

•  The need for consistent awareness of engineering technology among manufacturing 

• 

companies is highlighted, as Industry 5.0 emerges. 
Industry 5.0's focus on mass customisation requires international collaboration and innovative 
technologies like blockchain, mixed reality, drones, and additive manufacturing. 

Video 8: Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing 

•  Additive technologies like 3D printing are transforming various industries, including 
healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and mining, under the umbrella of Industry 5.0. 

•  The popularity of 3D printing is driven by its ability to create previously unattainable parts and 

reduce supply chain costs. 

•  Supply chain inefficiencies, caused by variability in spare parts demand, have prompted 

companies to explore 3D printing solutions to streamline operations. 

•  3D printing's evolution began in 1986, with early projects such as 3D-printed kidneys and self-

replicating printers. Significant advancements occurred in prosthetics and biomedical 
applications in the 2000s. 

•  Key industries benefiting from 3D printing include aerospace, consumer goods, healthcare, 

and manufacturing. 

•  Current challenges in 3D printing primarily involve materials and structural integrity, with 

research focused on cost-effective alternatives. 

•  Aerospace leaders like Boeing and NASA employ 3D printing for complex components and 

parts that are challenging to produce traditionally. 

•  Bioprinting is an emerging field, with research into printing live cells and tissues conducted by 

institutions like the University of Toronto and McGill. 

•  Commercialising 3D printing, especially in healthcare, poses complexities, including the need 

to demonstrate practical use and secure funding for certain applications.
