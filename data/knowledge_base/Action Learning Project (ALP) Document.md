DBS Case Study: Strategic Planning

What were the key strategic decisions that guided DBS's digital transformation? 

Adopting Strategy 2.0: "Making Banking Joyful"

The bank shifted from Strategy 1.0 ("Asia's Bank of Choice in the New Asia") to Strategy 2.0 with a clear focus on "Making Banking Joyful" by leveraging digitalization to make banking 'invisible' for customers

 This was backed by a significant S$200 million (US$147 million) investment in digital transformation

Following Three Strategic Initiatives

DBS implemented Strategy 2.0 around three core strategic initiatives:

Digital to the Core: Investing in completely transforming legacy systems and technology infrastructure

Customer-Obsessed Approach: Embedding themselves in the customer journey to make banking invisible

Creating a Start-up Culture: Transforming into a "22,000-person start-up" (later 28,000) by fostering experimentation, innovation, and agile thinking

Insourcing Technology Development

DBS made the critical decision to insource technology development rather than continuing to outsource. This reversed their previous approach where 85% of technology services were outsourced

By 2018, DBS had flipped this ratio, with 90% of technology being self-managed

Implementing GANDALF Vision

The bank set a goal to be the "D" among global tech giants (Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, LinkedIn, and Facebook) adopting best practices from these companies rather than comparing themselves only to other banks



Moving to the Cloud

DBS made a strategic decision to migrate to cloud-native infrastructure, which allowed them to consolidate and reduce their physical server footprint by 75% while enabling 10x excess capacity to scale

Developing New Digital Scorecards

The bank created new metrics (initially ATE: Acquire, Transact, Engage, later evolved to EATE with Ecosystems added) and allocated 20% of the Balanced Scorecard to "Making Banking Joyful".

Launching Digibank India

DBS launched India's first mobile-only bank with no physical branches, which demonstrated the potential of digitalization and served as a confidence builder internally.

Creating an API Ecosystem

The bank launched the world's largest banking API platform with more than 200 APIs and 80+ partners, enabling seamless integration with external partners and expanding their digital ecosystem

Fostering a "Culture by Design"

DBS deliberately built its ABCDE culture (Agile, Be a learning organization, Customer-obsessed, Data-driven, Experiment and take risks) through intentional programs like hackathons, which involved 15,000 employees in at least one innovation project by 2018.

These strategic decisions collectively transformed DBS from a traditional bank into a technology company providing banking services, ultimately leading to its recognition as the Best Bank in the World.



How did DBS's shift from 'project' to 'platform' influence its strategic planning? 

Restructured Organizational Approach

From Siloed Projects to Integrated Platforms

Prior to the shift, DBS had 198 ongoing projects for the consumer bank division alone, creating bureaucratic complexity and slow delivery. The platform approach consolidated these disparate projects into integrated platforms organized around customer needs and business outcomes rather than individual initiatives.

Reorganization for Success

DBS reorganized its teams around platforms rather than individual projects. This meant establishing platform teams with the specific mandate to deliver desired outcomes, creating a structural foundation for their strategic planning.

Transformed Governance and Decision-Making

From Control to Context

One of the most significant changes was shifting from what CTO David Gledhill called "control to context". Instead of steering committees requiring multiple approvals at every stage, platform owners received funding and autonomy to determine how to achieve business outcomes, dramatically changing how strategic decisions were made and executed.

Elimination of Bureaucracy

The bank attacked layers of bureaucracy, eliminating the need for multiple approvals and committees that had previously slowed down innovation and implementation. This freed up strategic planning to focus on outcomes rather than processes.

Aligned Business and Technology

"Business equals technology; technology equals business"

The platform approach introduced the mantra that "business equals technology; technology equals business," creating a "Two in a Box" collaborative leadership model where tech and business heads worked together with shared goals and KPIs. This fundamentally changed how strategic planning incorporated technology decisions.

Shared Accountability

Rather than separate and potentially opposing goals (e.g., business targeting revenue while technology focused on stability), the platform approach created shared accountability for business outcomes, customer experience, and technology performance.

Enhanced Agility and Speed

DevOps and Automation

The platform approach incorporated principles like DevOps and automation, enabling faster deployment of new products and features. This allowed strategic planning to account for much faster implementation timelines and more rapid iteration based on market feedback.

Rapid Learning Cycles

With nearly 100% automated testing and deployment, strategic planning could incorporate shorter feedback loops and more experimental approaches, knowing that ideas could be tested quickly with customers.

Customer-Centric Planning

Platforms Centered Around Customer Journeys

Strategic planning shifted to center around customer journeys and solving "jobs to be done"

 rather than internal product development timelines, fundamentally changing what was prioritized.

Digital Ecosystems

The platform approach enabled DBS to create entire ecosystems and marketplaces (for cars, property, electricity), allowing strategic planning to envision much broader value propositions beyond traditional banking products.

Financial Planning Transformation

Investment Allocation

Strategic financial planning changed from allocating budgets to specific projects with detailed business cases to providing funding to platforms with broad outcome goals, trusting platform teams to determine the best use of resources.

Measuring Digital Value Capture

The new approach led to the creation of metrics to track "digital value capture," proving that digitally active customers delivered higher revenue, lower cost-to-income ratios, and higher Return-On-Equity (ROE), which in turn influenced future strategic investment decisions.
