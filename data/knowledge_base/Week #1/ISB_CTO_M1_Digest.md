Week 1: Role of a CTO: Introduction 

The  role  of  the  Chief  Technology  Officer  (CTO)  is  gaining  significant  prominence  in 
today's  digital  economy,  where  every  company  is  now  operating  as  a  technology 
company.  

In  this  dynamic  environment  marked  by  volatility,  uncertainty,  complexity,  and 
ambiguity, competition has intensified not only among traditional rivals but also with the 
emergence of new players known as digital giants. Companies like Facebook, Amazon, 
Apple, and Google leverage their technological knowledge and capabilities to disrupt 
various  industries,  including  finance,  healthcare,  and  education.  Simultaneously,  the 
presence  of  numerous  tech  entrepreneurs  further  intensifies  the  competition  and 
innovation landscape.  

As a result, incumbent companies, digital giants, and tech entrepreneurs are all striving 
to harness technology as a platform for innovation and competitive advantage. Thus, 
the  need  for  effective  leadership  arises,  complementing  the  existing  capabilities  of 
CEOs  and  other  senior  business  executives.  In  this  context,  as  technology  strategy 
becomes tightly intertwined with business strategy, firms face the question of how to 
respond effectively. 

Dr Mark Maybury, the CTO of Stanley Black & Decker, emphasises that technology, for 
the first time in our history, can help solve challenges not only for corporations but also 
for society as a whole. This reality prompts firms of all sizes to contemplate the creation 
of new roles that can enhance their ability to thrive in this new world. This is where the 
role of the CTO becomes particularly important.  

A  survey  conducted  by  Deloitte  and  the  Wall  Street  Journal  (2020  Deloitte  WSJ 
Intelligence global survey) revealed the following: 

•  93% of CEOs recognise technology as the key driver of competitive advantage 

and innovation.  

•  84% of CEOs consider mastering technology a critical challenge and the key to 

their success. 

•  40%  of  CEOs  view  technology  as  the  primary  differentiating  factor  in  their 

competitive strategies.  

Need for a CTO role 

The  role  of  a  Chief  Technology  Officer  (CTO)  has  its  roots  in  the  dot-com  boom 
revolution. During that time, companies like Amazon, E-Trade, and eBay emerged as 
pioneers  of  the  dot-com  revolution,  led  by  founders  who  possessed  extensive 
technological  knowledge.  These  visionary  founders  recognised  the  potential  of 
technology as the foundation for creating new businesses and strategies on the internet. 
Consequently,  there  arose  a  need  for  individuals  who  could  complement  their 
entrepreneurial  vision  by  overseeing  the  development  of  robust  and  scalable

technology infrastructure. This led to the emergence of the role of the Chief Technology 
Officer, whose responsibilities included: 

•  Working with technology vendors 
•  Creating a technology strategy 
•  Architecting the technology platform 
• 

Integrate seamlessly emerging technologies for product, service, and customer 
offerings. 

Roles of a CTO 

Over  the  past  two  decades,  the  role  of  the  Chief  Technology  Officer  has  evolved  to 
become even more integral to how businesses operate on a technological foundation. 
As companies have grown in size, the necessity of having a Chief Technology Officer 
has persisted.  

Today,  the  CTO  is  an  executive  who:  oversees  the  technology  vision,  direction,  and 
strategy of the company. They are: 

• 

Is responsible for  

o  Determining the key technologies to incorporate into the infrastructure. 
o  Sourcing those technologies from vendors. 
o  Forming partnerships.  

• 

Is externally focussed on customers and undertakes tasks such as: 

o  Shaping the product vision. 
o  Determining product availability.  
o  Conducting customer experiments.  

Interestingly, the Chief Technology Officer has become one of the external faces of the 
company  and  is  now  a  member  of  the  C-suite,  alongside  the  CEO,  Chief  Operating 
Officer, and other executives. 

Duties of a CTO 

The duties of a Chief Technology Officer encompass:  

•  Developing long-term technology strategy and vision of the company. 
• 

Identifying the appropriate technology stack to align with the business model and 
vision. 

•  Recruiting talent for critical technical roles. 
•  Representing  the  technical  side  of  the  company  to  important  stakeholders, 

including the board of directors, customers, and suppliers.  

The CTO plays a translational or boundary-spanning role, bridging the gap between the 
business strategy and the technology strategy, ensuring that the technology strategy 
enables the business strategy.

Value delivery by CTOs 

In order to assess the effectiveness and purpose of CTOs within an organisation, it is 
important to understand the dimensions of value that they deliver.  

Innovation: 

This  dimension  emphasises  on  the  critical  role  of  CTOs  as  facilitators  of  a  firm's 
technology strategy and as drivers of digital innovation. CTOs have the ability to shed 
light on the direction of technology trends and their implications for the business. They 
can  help  organisations  understand  the  significance  of  technologies  such  as  cloud 
computing,  artificial  intelligence  (AI),  and  quantum  computing.  By  envisioning  how 
innovation,  customer  relationships, 
these 
operations, and even business models, CTOs serve as catalysts for new possibilities 
enabled by digital innovation. 

transform  product 

technologies  can 

Purpose: 

The  second  dimension  highlights  the  importance  of  connecting  new  ideas  with  a 
strategic business case beyond financial considerations. CTOs can shape a business 
case  around  technology  that  goes  beyond  mere  financial  analysis.  They  can  steer 
attention towards the strategic implications of innovation, asking questions such as how 
it  can  reduce  environmental  impact,  decrease  job  stress,  or  enable  talent  reskilling. 
CTOs can also drive attention towards responsible computing, particularly in the context 
of AI, by addressing ethical concerns and ensuring the use of citizen data in an ethical 
manner. 

Partnerships: 

This  dimension  recognises  that  innovation  and  value  creation  extend  beyond  the 
boundaries of a single firm. CTOs play a crucial role in bringing together partnership 
ecosystems  for  the  organisation,  encompassing  both  existing  and  new  partnerships. 
They can cultivate relationships with companies specialising in emerging technologies 
or digital innovation, leveraging external knowledge and expertise. CTOs also serve as 
a  translational  voice  to  customers,  educating  them  about  potential  products  and 
services stemming from digital innovation and investments.

In summary, the value delivered by CTOs is defined by their contributions in the areas 
of innovation, purpose, and partnerships. They serve as facilitators of digital innovation, 
exploring  the  implications  of  emerging  technologies  and  trends.  CTOs  can  shape  a 
strategic  business  case  around  technology,  encompassing  values  beyond  financial 
considerations. Furthermore, they foster partnerships and ecosystems, both internally 
and externally, to unlock the full potential of digital innovation and create value for the 
organisation. 

CTO vs CIO 

While the CIO role has been well-known for a long time, it is crucial to understand the 
distinction  and  unique  contributions  of  a  CTO  in  today's  context.  Although  there  are 
various ways to differentiate these roles, they share synergies while  also possessing 
distinct characteristics. 

The CIO role can be described as inward-looking and 

•  Focuses  on  enhancing  business  efficiency  and  effectiveness 

through 

improvements in business processes and data management.  

•  Aligns technology with the business to drive operational efficiency, innovation, 

speed, and agility.  

In contrast, the CTO role is more outward-looking and  

•  Concentrates  on  exploring  new  technologies  and  forming  partnerships  with 

• 

• 

vendors.  
Is driven by leveraging technology to enhance customer offerings and advocate 
for an innovative product portfolio.  
Involves understanding and supporting the voice of the customer internally within 
the organisation.  

The distinctions between the CIO and CTO can be tabulated as below:  

Primary focus 

Stakeholders 
Metrics of

Both the CTO and the CIO play necessary and important roles in organisations and are 
connected  by  the  notion  that  firms  must  be  strategic  and  innovative  in  their  use  of 
technology, as in today's landscape competitive advantage stems from IT and digital 
offerings. However, their focuses differ as follows:

Focuses on  
•  Applying IT to internal 

operations, 

•  Managing IT personnel, 
services, applications 

•  Reducing internal transaction 

•

performance 

CTO 

Focuses on  
•  Applying technology to products and 

services 

•  Managing digital R&D and innovation, 

Stimulating the creation of new products and 
services, both internally and externally,  

•  Positioning the company for long-term 

competitive advantage 

•  Building new partnerships and ecosystems. 

Shared responsibilities of CTO and CIO 

These  are  related  to  data  privacy,  innovation  strategy,  ecosystem  strategy,  software 
development life cycle, cybersecurity, and working with the C-Suite. However, the CIO 
applies  these  concepts  internally  to  enhance  the  organisation's  supply  chain 
management, customer relationship processes, HR processes, end-user experience, 
business  continuity,  and  scalability.  In  contrast,  the  CTO's  focus  remains  external, 
addressing customer-oriented technology strategy, the portfolio of product and service 
offerings, and the external technology architecture.  

It  is  essential  to  recognise  the  importance  of  both  roles  as  they  diverge  due  to  the 
increasing significance of digital innovation and strategy. 

Qualities of a CTO 

The  primary role  of  a CTO  is to  maintain an  external focus  and  their  responsibilities 
revolve  around  comprehending  customer  needs  and  identifying  potential  partnership 
opportunities. The CTO’s qualities can thus b categorised into four dimensions:  

•  Ability to understand customer needs, external trends and collaborations  
•  Strategic planning  
•  Team management  
•  Project management 

These dimensions can be better understood by examining the four distinct personas 
that a CTO embodies within the organisational framework.  

Digital business leader 

In this role the CTO skilfully harmonising technology and business to create innovative 
products,  services,  and  business  models.  Hence,  their  proficiency  as  a  catalyst  for 
strategic  initiatives,  adeptness  in  strategic  planning,  and  deep  understanding  of 
customer needs are vital to their success as digital business leaders. 

Digital innovator 

A CTO acts as catalysts for innovation, identifying areas where technology can enhance 
business  operations.  Consequently,  proficiency  in  strategic  planning  and  project

management  becomes  crucial  in  effectively  applying  strategic  thinking  to  innovative 
ideas and successfully executing them. 

Digital strategy catalyst 

Aligned with the concept of a business leader, the CTO plays a pivotal role in educating 
others  about  digital  innovation.  Often  assuming  the  position  of  an  evangelist,  they 
facilitate the organisation-wide understanding of digital innovation principles, applicable 
to various domains such as customer relationships and supply chain management. 

Business enabler of technology leverage 

In  today's  context,  a  firm's  success  hinges  on  its  ability  to  continually  leverage 
technology for ongoing innovation. While the CTO may contribute ideas, true success 
lies  in  enabling  others  to  think  like  a  CTO.  Thus,  the  CTO  assumes  the  role  of 
empowering the organisation to effectively leverage technology, acting as a catalyst for 
technological progress. 

Revisiting the defining qualities of a CTO, they encompass a focus on customer needs, 
strategic planning, team management, and project management. Two sub-dimensions 
that come into play under project management are

A  CTO's  multifaceted  role  in  combining  technology  and  business  requires  a 
comprehensive skill set and a deep understanding of external dynamics, enabling them 
to drive innovation and guide the organisation towards technological success. 

Factors Affecting the Role of a CTO 

The role and expectations of a CTO can be influenced by various factors. These factors 
can vary depending on the following: 

Let's explore each of these factors in detail. 

Industry sector  

In the context of digital innovation and the digital economy, it is meaningful to categorise 
industry sectors as either tech or non-tech.  

•  Tech companies 

o  Producers  of 

technology  products  and  services, 

including  digital 

companies like Amazon, Apple, and Netflix.  

o  The CTO's role is to translate the tech vision into products, services, and 

infrastructure.  
•  Non-tech companies 

o  Traditionally consumers of IT services, for example companies such as 
Hindustan Lever, Maruti, Procter & Gamble, Reliance, and Tata Hotels  
o  The  CTO  complements  the  CIO’s  role  by  educating  others,  building 
infrastructure, translating digital aspects into products and services, and 
driving innovation. 

Size of organisation 

•  Small-sized companies 

o  CTO  often  takes  on  additional  responsibilities  such  as  Chief  Marketing 

Officer, Chief Revenue Officer, or Chief Growth Officer.  

o  They  have  a  front-facing  role  with  customers,  suppliers,  and  external 

partners, focusing on innovation, purpose, and partnerships.  

•  Medium-sized organisations  

o  The CTO becomes a more specialised member of the team  
o  They are involved in organisational building, acquiring and leading people 
and  skills,  developing  technology  vision,  orchestrating  the  ecosystem, 
and forming open innovation networks. 

o

•  Large organisations  

o  The CTO becomes even more specialised and collaborative, taking on a 

big-picture thinker role.  

o  They focus on future technology trends and strategic planning. 

Company maturity 

•  Start-ups 

o  The CTO's role is often frenzied and ad hoc due to the need to develop 

products, find customers, secure funding, and ensure survival.  

•  Mature organisations 

o  The  CTO's  role  becomes  more  deliberative  and  well-defined,  while  still 

maintaining an external orientation.  

o  Collaboration and culture-building through teams become crucial aspects 

of the CTO's responsibilities in mature organisations. 

Organisation offering 

•  Product companies 

CTO  focusses  on  R&D,  voice  of  the  customer,  concept  testing,  and  quality 
assurance.  

•  Software companies  

CTO  places  a  stronger  emphasis  on  software  development  lifecycle,  project 
management,  software  maturity,  and  product  quality 
from  a  software 
perspective. 

In summary, the role of a CTO can vary based on several factors: industry sector (tech 
vs. non-tech), organisation size, company maturity, and primary offering (product vs. 
software).  Understanding  these  factors  helps  to  contextualise  and  define  the 
expectations and responsibilities of a CTO within different organisations. 

The Role of a CTO in Different Sized Organisations 

In a start-up 

When it comes to start-ups, the responsibilities and tasks of a CTO differ slightly from 
those in other companies. In order to understand the role of a CTO in a startup, it is 
important to delve deeper into their specific functions. In a startup,  

•  The CTO serves as the bridge between the business and the technology team.  
•  To  the business, the CTO  is seen as the  tech  expert,  while to  the  technology 

team, the CTO is seen as the business expert.  

•  The CTO to act as a translator, effectively conveying the needs and requirements 

between these two domains. 

The startup CTO must be versatile and wear multiple hats. They are often hired to be 
hands-on in development tasks. Additionally, the CTO should possess a fair degree of 
business domain knowledge, have a vision for the company, and understand customer 
needs.  

 ISB CTO 

8  

 
   
  
  
It is important to differentiate between customer needs and wants, as exemplified by 
Steve Jobs' famous statement: "We give the customer what they will need, not what 
they want." This implies understanding the customer's context and how technology can 
improve their lives, sometimes addressing needs the customer may not be aware of. 
Thus, the CTO also plays a vital role in educating customers about the product offering 
and how it fulfils important customer wants. 

Furthermore, the CTO is responsible for translating the company's vision and mission, 
identifying obstacles and challenges, and finding practical solutions. Let us look at some 
issues and solutions that a CTO may suggest: 

The CTO's commitment to fostering a functional culture is also essential. Startups are 
known for their frenzied, chaotic, and ad hoc environments, which can potentially burn 
out employees. Alongside the CEO, the CTO may have a significant role in boosting 
morale and keeping the team motivated, as these factors contribute to the success of 
the startup. 

In  summary,  the  role  of  a  CTO  in  a  startup  encompasses  various  responsibilities, 
including  involvement  in  minimum  viable  product  development,  enhancing  user 
experience,  overseeing  application  architecture,  managing  vendor  and  customer 
relationships, and talent management. 

In a mid-sized firm 

In a midsize firm, the CTO has fewer responsibilities due to the presence of specialised 
individuals  in  various  departments  such  as  marketing,  manufacturing,  and  customer 
relationships.  Consequently,  the  CTO's  role  becomes  more  collaborative  within  the 
team. In this context, the CTO's primary focus is on  

•  Creating and overseeing the technology strategy 
•  Envisioning how technology will be utilised and implemented 
•  Aiming to increase the maturity of technology processes  

 ISB CTO 

9  

 
   
  
  
 
•  Transitioning  from  an  ad  hoc  and  chaotic  environment  to  a  more  organised 

structure with defined processes 

As a result, the CTO becomes less hands-on and more focused on  

•  Enabling teams 
•  Cultivating a suitable culture 
• 
•  Building a larger team and formalising roles 

Implementing methodologies.  

Instead of having extensive knowledge in every aspect, the CTO becomes a big-picture 
thinker  who  can  articulate  a  global  vision  and  translate  it  into  specific  projects  or 
technology initiatives. Additionally, the CTO needs to possess a solid understanding of 
prioritising urgency versus importance. 

In a large-sized firm 

In a large firm, specialisation is even more prominent, with various individuals fulfilling 
specialised  roles.  In  such  companies,  the  role  of  the  CTO  transforms  into  that  of an 
evangelist and strategic thinker. Although the CTO still sets the strategy, culture, and 
technology  direction,  their  primary  focus  is  on  future-proofing  the  business.  This 
involves identifying potential challenges, trends, and changes in the market to position 
the business strategically and prevent obsolescence. The CTO assumes the role of a 
charismatic  visionary,  serving  as  a  spokesperson  and  a  vital  member  of  the 
leadership  team.  They  often  contribute  to board  meetings  and  establish  connections 
with leaders from other companies, particularly in the technology sector.  

It is evident that the role of a CTO varies significantly between startups, midsize firms, 
and large companies. 

Skills of a CTO 

The  role  of  a  CTO  encompasses  a  core  set  of  skills  that  are  essential  for  success. 
Mastering  these  skills  enables  a  CTO  to  excel  in  their  role  and  drive  technological 
excellence within the organisation. Let us briefly look into each of these skills.

Future of the CTO Role  

The future of the CTO lies in harnessing the synergy between human capability and 
technological  advancements,  with  vast  potential  awaiting  exploration.  As  technology 
continues to advance, new roles and skills will emerge, necessitating adaptive thinking 
from CTOs who will guide their teams through these transformative changes. They will 
motivate their colleagues, allay any fears stemming from the unknown, and steer the 
organisation towards success. 

As companies expand, the responsibilities of the CTO expand as well. Their focus shifts 
towards nurturing the potential of their personnel, moving beyond the technical aspects 
and  emphasising  the  importance  of  collaborative  teamwork  in  advancing  the 
organisation's objectives. The CTO must facilitate an environment where people and 
teams can effectively collaborate for the betterment of the business.
