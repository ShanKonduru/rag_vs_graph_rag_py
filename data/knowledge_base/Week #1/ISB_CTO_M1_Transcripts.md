Week 1: Role of CTO: Introduction 

Video 1: Module Overview  

Hello,  welcome  to  our  module  on  the  Chief  Technology  Officer.  You  might  wonder 
what's  so  special  and  unique  about  the  chief  technology  officer.  It  is  a  role  that  is 
increasingly growing in prominence, especially in today's digital economy where every 
company is now a tech company. One of the challenges that companies are facing is, 
in an environment of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, the intensity of 
competition is growing, not just from their traditional rivals, but also from new rivals. In 
the tech sector, we call them the digital giants. Companies such as Facebook, Amazon, 
Apple, Google, which are using their knowledge and their capabilities with technology 
to disrupt every known industry, whether it be finance, healthcare, education and so on. 
At  the  same  time,  there  are  a  lot  of  tech  entrepreneurs.  So,  as  a  result,  the  due 
battlefield of competition and innovation is in the space where incumbent companies, 
digital giants and tech entrepreneurs, are all trying to figure out how technology can be 
the platform for innovation and competitive advantage. So, when everything becomes 
technology, there is need for leadership. Leadership that can supplement the existing 
capabilities of the CEO as well as the other existing senior business executives. So, 
today,  when  technology  strategy  is  tightly  intertwined  with  business  strategy,  how 
should firms respond?   

To  offer  you  a  quote  from  Dr.  Mark  Maybury,  who  is  the  chief  technology  officer  of 
Stanley Black & Decker. He notes that, for the first time in our species, technology can 
help us solving most of the challenges and problems, not just for corporations but also 
for society.  And  so, how do  you  respond? So,  regardless of  firms;  small  firms,  large 
firms, everybody has a similar anxiety. What new roles should we create in order to help 
us improve our ability to succeed in this new world? And that's where the role of a chief 
technology officer becomes very important. As an example, a survey done by Deloitte 
and Wall Street Journal finds that, 93% of CEOs assert that technology is the key to 
driving competitive advantage and innovation. 84% of all the CEOs say that mastering 
technology is a critical challenge and the key to their success. And about half of them 
say that technology is going to become the key differentiator for how they compete. So, 
in this regard, our focus will be on understanding some of the following topics. Why is 
digital strategy and innovation at the heart of competitive advantage? What is the role 
of a chief technology officer? Is this role different from the well-known role of a chief 
information officer? What skills does the chief technology officer need? And are there 
different types of roles that chief technology officers play depending upon the nature of 
the  company?  So,  I  look  forward  to  talking  about  these  topics  in  the  modules  to  be 
coming up soon, and I look forward to seeing you.

Video 2: CTO: Role and Duties 

So, what are the roles of a chief technology officer, and how do we understand the term 
chief technology officer?   

The role of a chief technology officer originated  during the dot-com boom revolution. If 
you  remember,  companies  like  Amazon,  E*Trade,  eBay,  these  were  some  of  the 
forerunners of the dot-com revolution. These were companies started by founders who 
were very knowledgeable about technology. But more importantly, their vision was that 
technology could be the foundation. Creating a new business, a new business strategy, 
creating  business  on  the  internet.  So,  in  during  those  times,  there  was  a  need  for  a 
person who could complement the entrepreneurial vision of the founders' by overseeing 
the development of the technology infrastructure. Working with technology vendors and 
creating the technology strategy in such a way that the infrastructure was robust, was 
reliable, it was scalable because after all, how can you do business on a technology 
platform if it is not reliable, scalable and flexible? So, that was the impetus for the role 
of a chief technology officer. Originally, very much focused upon creating a vision for 
technology, architecting the technology platform, thinking about what are the emerging 
technologies, and how can they all be integrated together seamlessly to deliver product, 
service  and  customer  offerings.  Today,  after  20  years,  that  role  continues  to  be  still 
relevant, but it has grown to be even more fundamental into how businesses operate 
on a technology foundation. Even as companies have grown larger, they have felt the 
necessity to continue to have a chief technology officer. So, who is a chief technology 
officer? The chief technology officer is an executive who oversees the technology vision 
and direction and strategy for the company. Such a person is responsible for elements 
such as, what are the key technologies that we will incorporate into our infrastructure? 
Where  will  we  source  those  technologies  from?  With  which  vendors  will  we  form 
partnerships? But beyond that, the role of a chief technology officer has also continued 
to  evolve  into  an  external  focus  on  the  customers  such  as  what  will  be  the  product 
vision? How will we make our products available? How will we do experiments with our 
customers?  So,  interestingly,  the  chief  technology  officer  is  not  just  a  technology 
visionary,  but  increasingly  one  of  the  external  faces  of  the  company.  And  the  chief 
technology  officer  increasingly  is  part  of  the  C-suite  along  with  the  CEO,  the  chief 
operating officer and other chief executives.  

So, what are some of the duties, what are some of the things that a chief technology 
officer does? A chief technology officer develops the long-term technology strategy and 
vision  of  the  company.  Secondly,  a  chief  technology  officer  identifies  the  right 
technology stack to translate the business model and the business vision into a reliable 
and robust technology strategy. Third, the chief technology officer is also responsible 
for recruiting talent, particularly the software designers, the product architectures, the 
engineers, the database architects, the ones who are important in continuing to build 
and  enhance  the  technology  infrastructure.  And  the  chief  technology  officer  also 
represents the technical side of the company to critical stakeholders, whether it be the 
board of directors, whether it be customers or whether it be suppliers. In other words, 
the  role  of  a  chief  technology  officer  is  to  complement  the  technology  side  of  the 
business,  as  the  CEO  and  business  executives  talk  about  the  business  side  of  the 

 ISB CTO 

2  

 
   
  
  
organisation and be able to translate the business strategy into the technology strategy 
and  vice  versa.  Meaning  that,  how  will  the  technology  strategy  enable  the  business 
strategy? So, as you can see, this is a pretty translational or boundary spanning role, 
and that's the growth opportunity of the chief technology officer. 

Video 3: Value Delivery by CTOs 

How do Chief Technology Officers deliver value?   

Are there dimensions of value that we can define and understand so that we can assess 
what  makes  a  good  CTO  and  what  is  their  purpose  in  an  organisation?  So,  we  will 
identify  three  dimensions  of  value  delivery  by  a  Chief  Technology  Officer.  They  are 
innovation, purpose and partnerships. So, let's understand each one of them in turn. 
Innovation: Today, it is even more clear that digital innovation is the engine of growth 
and competitive advantage. As primary facilitators of a firm's technology strategy, CTOs 
control  the  levers  that  accelerate  discovery  and  innovation.  Today,  innovation  is  a 
competitive  battleground,  and  Chief  Technology  Officers  can  shine  a  light  on  the 
technology direction. What are the big broad trends and what does it mean to business? 
For example, what is the significance of a cloud technology for business? How does it 
help us redefine customer relationships? How does it help us create new products and 
services to the customers? Today, automated driving is driving in the cloud, so the cloud 
has significant implications for autonomous vehicles. Similarly, Internet of technology. 
What is the implication of that for a manufacturing organisation? How will analytics help 
us  redefine  our  marketing  strategy?  These  are  the  kind  of  ways  in  which  a  Chief 
Technology Officer can help an organisation understand the implications of technology 
for their firm's innovation. CTOs are indeed chief innovators, both of technology as well 
as of the business models. They should, for example, be able to see how cloud, AI or 
quantum  computing  can  transform  new  product  innovation,  customer  relationships, 
operations or even new business models. So, to summarise it, CTOs are catalysts and 
stimulants of new possibilities made feasible through digital innovation. 

The second dimension of CTO value, let's call it purpose. In every organisation, one of 
the  challenges  is  how  are  we  going  to  connect  a  new  idea  with  how  do  we  make  a 
business case for it. The easy one in an organisation is to make a financial business 
case.  But a  financial business  case  can be  very conservative. What  are  the  values? 
What  are  the  ways  in  which  we  can  inspire  the  strategic  business  case?  In  today's 
economy,  where  the  purpose  of  business  is  not  just  to  make  profit  but  also  to  be 
conscious of  the  environment,  conscious  of society,  are  there  broad  values  that  can 
inspire how do we think about that innovation idea? CTOs can make a business case 
around technology, not just the financial case, but they can also steer attention toward 
a strategic business case. They can help answer questions such as: Will this innovation 
reduce environmental impact? Will it reduce job stress? Will it help us reskill our talent 
to  become  future-ready?  CTOs  can  also  help  drive  attention  toward  responsible 
computing, a term that we are beginning to use more and more, especially with AI. By 
helping answer, hard-to-answer but important questions such as, will this minimise the 
impact  of  the  infrastructure  investment  on  the  environment?  Will  we  be  able  to  use 
citizen data in ethical ways? Will we be able to cater to humanity that we serve? So, as 

 ISB CTO 

3  

 
   
  
  
you can see, beyond innovation, the purpose dimension refers to how can CTOs build 
an inspirational business case. 

The third element of value delivery, let's call it partnerships. Today, innovation and value 
creation no longer occurs only inside the firm, but it occurs outside the boundaries of 
the firm, between the firm and its current and new partners. CTOs are the glue to bring 
a partnership ecosystem together for the company, both existing partnerships and new 
partnerships.  They  can  help  develop  partnerships  with  other  companies,  especially 
those that specialise in emerging technologies or new digital innovation ideas. In a way, 
CTOs have a front seat view on digital innovation ideas, and they know who is doing 
them  well  in  ways  they  can  complement  the  knowledge  and  success  of  their  own 
organisation.  So,  they're  at  the  front  end  of,  how  do  we  build  these  relationships. 
Additionally,  CTOs  are  also  a  translational  voice  to  customers.  They  can  help  an 
organisation educate its customers about the potential products and services that can 
arise from digital innovation, from the digital infrastructure, from the digital investments. 
So,  we  can  say  that  ecosystems  and  partnerships  are  vital  to  unlocking  digital 
innovation and value. It can help answer specific questions and the CTOs can play a 
role  in  addressing  questions  such  as:  What  will  be  the  data  sharing  policies  and 
practices  with  our  partners?  What  will  be  the  policies  for  compliance?  How  will 
workflows extend outside our organisation into our ecosystem and into our partners? 
Will there be a common approach to addressing cybersecurity needs? What in open 
innovation  opportunities  will  we  pursue?  These  are  elements  of  what  we  call  the 
partnership  dimension.  So,  to  summarise,  the  value  created  by  the  CTO  for  any 
organisation is defined in terms of innovation, purpose and partnerships.   

Video 4: CTO vs CIO 

Here is an important question. How is the role of a CTO different from that of a CIO? 
After all, the Chief Information Officer role is very well known. It's been in existence for 
a very long time. Why do we need a CTO today? How is that role different from what a 
CIO does? There are many ways of looking at the distinctions between these roles, and 
we will go through some of those distinctions to identify the fact that the CTO and the 
CIO roles are in some ways synergistic and some ways distinct and unique.  We can 
describe  the  CIO  role  as  more  inward  looking  and  focused  on  improving  business 
efficiency and effectiveness, particularly by focusing on business processes and data. 
A CIO's contribution to an organisation is how can we enhance technology business 
alignment to improve operating efficiency, innovation, speed and agility. In contrast, the 
role of a CTO is more outward looking.  

The  CTO  is  focused  on  new  technologies  and  vendor  partnerships.  CTO  is  focused 
upon  how  to  use  the  technology  to  improve  customer  offerings,  and  how  to  be  an 
advocate  for  the  innovative  product  portfolio  with  customers.  And  the  CTO's  role  is 
focused  upon  learning  how  to  support  the  voice  of  the  customer  internal  to  the 
organisation. So, CTO is more outward looking, and the CIO is more inward looking. 
We  can  advance  this  idea  further  by  saying  that  the  CIO's  focus  on  internal  IT 
operations means the CIO is focused on the IT infrastructure, business processes, core 
systems, process automation and data warehousing. Their stakeholder are the internal 

 ISB CTO 

4  

 
   
  
  
users,  and  the  metrics  of  their  success  are  cost  of  IT  operations,  reliability  and 
availability.  On  the  other  hand,  the  CTO  being  outward  looking,  their  focus  is  on 
technology trends, R&D, new products, new services, customer advocacy, voice of the 
customer. By focusing up on their customers, they have a much more direct impact on 
revenue and sales. Now, building further, we can say that both the CTO and the CIO 
are necessary and important because they're connected to the idea that firms must be 
more  strategic  and  innovative  through  their  use  of  technology.  After  all,  today, 
competitive advantage comes from IT and digital offerings.  

However, the CIO focuses on some of these aspects. How do you apply IT to internal 
operations?  How  do  you  manage  IT  personnel  and  IT  services  and  IT  applications? 
How do you reduce the cost of the internal transactions? How do you improve short-
term IT performance? How is the CTO role different? The CTO focuses on how can we 
apply technology to products and services, especially to creating new products and new 
services. How can we manage digital R&D and innovation? How can we stimulate the 
creation of new products and services through technology? In other words, mastering 
the innovation process both internal and external? How do we position the company for 
long-term  competitive  advantage?  How  do  we  build  new  partnerships  and  new 
ecosystems?  Let's  think  about  the  same  idea  in  a  different  way,  and  you'll  see  that 
reflected here in this graphic. Both of them have a shared responsibility for data privacy, 
innovation strategy, ecosystem strategy, software development life cycle, cyber security 
and working with the C-Suite. However, the CIO takes these concepts and applies them 
to the internal organisation, such as the supply chain management force, the customer 
relationship  process,  the  HR  process.  How do  we  enhance  the  end-user experience 
inside  the  organisation?  How  do  we  ensure  the  continuity  of  business  in  the  face  of 
potential  disruptions?  How  do  we  enhance  the  scalability  of  the  organisation?  What 
does the CTO do?  Out of the same shared responsibility for innovation, ecosystem and 
software development life cycle and cyber security, the CTO focuses externally on what 
should be the customer-oriented technology strategy. What should be the portfolio of 
product and service offerings to the customers? What should be the external-oriented 
technology  architecture?  And  this  is  important.  The  CIO  is  focused  on  the  internal 
technology architecture and the CTO is focused on the external technology architecture. 
So, as you can see, both roles important. One does not replace the other, but they are 
diverging because of the importance of digital innovation and strategy.   

Video 5: Qualities of a CTO 

What are the qualities of a chief technology officer? We'll summarise the qualities in 
four dimensions. Recall that we say the chief technology officer's primary role is to be 
external-focused.  So,  their  role  is  in  understanding  customer  needs  and  identifying 
partnership opportunities. So, their ability to understand customer needs and external 
trends  and  external  partners  is  the  first  important  quality.  Second  one  is  strategic 
planning. Third one is team management and fourth one is project management.   

We can think about these by identifying that a chief technology officer essentially has 
four different personas about how they are viewed in the organisation and how those 
mean that these four qualities are important.   

 ISB CTO 

5  

 
   
  
  
By now, it's clear that the chief technology officer is a digital business leader. Somebody 
who  can  understand  how  to  fuse  together  technology  and  business  in  creating  new 
products, new services, new business models. Therefore, their ability to be a strategy 
catalyst, their ability to know how to conduct strategic planning and to understand the 
needs of the customers is pretty important to their success as a digital business leader.  

A second important persona that helps us think about the qualities of a CTO is a digital 
innovator. A CTO is an innovation catalyst, somebody who identifies the sweet spots of 
opportunity  where  you  can  improve  business  through  technology.  So,  therefore,  the 
important qualities are strategic planning and project management. Understanding how 
to  apply  strategy  thinking  to  innovation  ideas,  and  then  how  to  deliver  upon  them 
through project management.  

The  third  important  persona  is  digital  strategy  catalyst.  Connected  again  with  the 
business  leader  idea,  how  to  help  educate  others  about  thinking  about  digital 
innovation. Very often a chief technology officer is an evangelist, who can help other 
members of the organisation learn about what is digital innovation and how should they 
be thinking about in their own area of activity, whether it be customer relationships or 
supply chain or name it.  

The fourth important persona is that of a business enabler of technology leverage. What 
does that mean? Today, firm's success is how well they can leverage technology on an 
ongoing basis in innovation. While a CTO can be a source of ideas, success is when 
others  are  also  able  to  think  like  a  CTO.  So,  he  or  she  is  a  business  enabler  of 
technology leverage. So, let's go back to once again defining the qualities of a CTO: 
Customer  needs,  strategic  planning,  team  management  and  project  management. 
Under  project  management,  we  can  now  identify  a  couple  of  important  other 
subdimensions. One of that is financial planning and management. Remember, we said 
that one of the ways in which CTO delivers value is by purpose, making the business 
case. So, a CTO should be skilled in financial management to help build the business 
case.  Similarly,  as  a  project  manager,  CTO  should  have  some  operations 
understanding, because projects are like running operations. So, those are additional 
dimensions of project management.  

We can describe the qualities of a CTO also in a different way. They are: be a champion 
of the customer, be a technology visionary, be an infrastructure commander and be a 
big picture thinker. Customer champion, meaning you are the external person. So, the 
CTO  should  be  skilled  in  being  the  voice  of the  customer, listening  to  the  customer, 
translating that into ideas and bringing them into the organisation, and similarly, taking 
ideas from the organisation to the customer. Technology visionary. Be open to the big 
trends,  understand  the  actions  of  technology  companies  and  read  the  TVs  to  know 
where trends are going. Today, for example, we are hearing a lot about generative AI. 
It should be the CTO who should be aware of what generative AI is, and before there 
is too much ambiguity about it, be able to help the organisation learn and vision what 
role generative AI will play in that company. Infrastructure commander. Remember, I 
said the CIO is internal-focused, CTO is external-focused. Firms are discovering that 

 ISB CTO 

6  

 
   
  
  
 
they  need  to  bury  and  build  two  different  infrastructures.  One  internal  facing,  one 
external facing. And the CTO is the commander, the orchestrator, the architect of that 
external architecture. Certainly, big picture thinker. He or she best understands what 
disruptive  impact  technology  will  likely have and how to prepare  the  organisation  for 
that. So, that's the big picture quality.   

Video 6: Factors Affecting a CTO’s Role 

What factors affect a CTO's role? Do CTOs play the same role in every organisation, 
or are there ways in which we can understand what changes the role and expectations 
of a CTO? So, we will identify four factors and describe how they influence the role of 
the CTO.  

What are these four factors? The first one we'll talk about is the type of industry sector 
in terms of tech versus non-tech. Second, we'll talk about the size of the organisation, 
small versus large. Third, we'll talk about company maturity, a start-up or incumbent or 
a more mature organisation. And then finally, is it in the product business or is it in the 
service business?  

So, let's look at each one of these factors turn by turn. Industry sector. Given that our 
conversation is about digital innovation, digital economy, it's more meaningful to think 
about industry sector as tech versus non-tech.  

Tech is companies that are the producers of technology products and services. They 
don't  just  include  the  traditional  IT  companies  like  hardware  and  software,  but  they 
increasingly include digital companies. Amazon would be a digital company or a tech 
company. Apple is a tech company; Netflix is a tech company.  

Who are the non-tech companies? These are the companies which were traditionally 
created to be consumers of IT to serve their customers. So, CPG companies, consumer 
product companies. Let's take Hindustan Lever, Maruti or Procter & Gamble, Reliance, 
Tata Hotels. All of these, so whether it be healthcare, retail, tourism, hospitality, retail, 
different examples. They were not born digital, but they are the consumers of IT, so we 
call them non-tech companies.   

In a tech company, one unique aspect is that most of the colleagues of a CTO, those 
who  are  in  the  C-Suite,  they  are  themselves  tech  visionaries.  Amazon  is  a  tech 
company. Jeff Bezos, when he started Amazon, he understood the Internet. He did not 
need help of being a technology visionary. Steve Jobs was a tech visionary. Google, 
it's a company full of tech visionaries. So, the business executives are tech visionaries, 
and you don't need the CTO to be focusing too much on that in terms of what are the 
business innovation opportunities. But the role of a CTO in a tech company is how do 
we translate that vision into products, services and infrastructure. Interestingly, in many 
of the tech companies, the role of a CIO is less important, whereas the role of a CTO is 
more important. In other words, the CTO is the primary owner, champion and facilitator 
of everything  that even  a  CIO  does.  So,  translating  the  vision  into  product,  services, 
infrastructure, everything is the role of a CTO, much more prominent.  

 ISB CTO 

7  

 
   
  
  
In  a  non-tech  company,  the  CIO  still  has  an  important  role.  So,  the  CTO  has  to 
complement the CIO role in the ways we discussed, internal versus external. Because 
many of the business executives are less tech-savvy, the role of a CTO is more in terms 
of  educate,  help  others  learn  about  the  digital,  build,  help  build  the  infrastructure, 
translate the digital into products and services and innovate. So, you can see a very 
clear distinction.  

Tech companies translate the vision, whereas in non-tech companies educate, build, 
translate, innovate.   

Let's  look  at  the  second  factor,  and  that  is  size.  In  small  companies,  simply  put, 
everybody does everything. Small group, so a CTO tends to be not just a technology 
officer, very often becomes the Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Revenue Officer or the 
Chief  Growth  Officer.  So,  the  CTO  has  a  more  prominent  front-end  facing  role  with 
customers,  suppliers  and  external  partners,  building  innovation,  purpose  and 
partnerships. 

In a medium-sized organisation, there are more executives; there are more colleagues, 
and the role of the CTO starts pivoting from doing everything to being a member of the 
team and  taking on  a more  specialised  role,  but  important  role. And  we  can  say  the 
CTO's role translates into organisation building, acquiring and leading people and skills, 
developing the technology vision, orchestrating the ecosystem and finding those open 
innovation networks. So, you can see from doing all-purpose everything to start doing 
specific  things  in  collaboration.  And  that's  an  important  word,  collaboration,  ability  to 
collaborate with others.  

What about large organisations? Even more specialised and collaborative member of 
a bigger team. Remember we said, a CTO is a big-picture thinker. Much more important 
to look at what's coming in the future, what are the technology trends, how should we 
be thinking about them? So, you can see how the role starts changing depending upon 
the size of the organisation.   

The third factor is maturity of the organisation. In a small start-up, everybody is much 
more  external-oriented  because  there's  a  race  between  developing  a  product,  the 
minimum viable product, finding the first, second, third customer, finding the source of 
funding, and it's a frenzy. It's ad hoc because it's survival. So, product development, 
product launch, finding the customer, acquiring more finances to keep going like that. 
So, that's where the role of a CTO becomes much more frenzied, ad hoc, and all hands-
on  deck.  In  a  mature  organisation,  the  role  becomes  much  more  deliberative,  not 
frenzied. It becomes much more well-defined, not ad hoc. But it still remains external-
oriented,  but  not  just  through  partnerships,  but  also  by  culture  building  through 
collaborations to instilling teams.  

So,  again  you  can  see  the  distinction  in  growing  from  a  start-up  to  a  mature 
organisation. The fourth dimension is, what's your primary offering? Are you a product 
company, or are you a software company? If you're a product company, then the focus 
is more upon R&D, voice of the customer, concept testing, A/B testing, and so on. If 
you're  a  software  company,  then  much  stronger emphasis  on  software  development 

 ISB CTO 

8  

 
   
  
  
lifecycle, project management, maturity or software development and ensuring product 
quality  from  a  software  perspective.  Small  distinctions  but  important  distinctions.  So, 
let's summarise it by saying that the role of a CTO varies depending upon the sector, 
tech versus non-tech, size, maturity, and what are you making, product versus software.   

Video 7: CTO: Role in Start-Ups 

Let's  dig  deeper  into  what  does  the  CTO  do  as  member  of  a  startup.  Because  we 
already said that one size does not fit all, CTOs are called upon to do some slightly 
different things in startups versus other company. So, what do they do in startups? Let's 
dig deeper.  

In a startup, to the business, the CTO is the tech guy. And to the technology team, the 
CTO is the business guy, meaning the CTO is the translator between the business and 
the tech side of the startup. The startup CTO needs to wear many hats. The CTO is 
generally hired to be hands-on in terms of development. CTO also needs to have fair 
degree  of  business  domain  knowledge,  needs  to  have  the  vision  and  the  ability  to 
understand  the  customer  needs.  And  by  the  way,  there's  an  important  distinction 
between customer needs and customer wants. Steve Jobs was famous for saying, "We 
give  the  customer  what  they  will  need,  not  what  they  want."  And  that's  an  important 
distinction,  meaning  that  it's  really  you're  trying  to  understand  the  customer  in  the 
context of their life and how technology will make their lives better. Sometimes those 
needs are things that the customer themselves may not be aware of. Hence, it's not just 
sufficing their needs, the CTO also plays an important role in educating the customer 
about the product offering and it helps how it serves an important customer want. 

In addition, the CTO also plays a role in translating the vision and the mission of the 
company, identifies the pitfalls and barriers to progress, and finds pragmatic solutions. 
What does that mean? If the company is going to run out of server capacity, he or she 
is the visionary, says, we need to pivot to the cloud. If the company needs analytics 
capability, he or she finds out where do we find the talent before the need becomes 
apparent? So, that's what we mean by finding pragmatic solutions. If funding is running 
low, then the CTO is important, finding out how can we bootstrap, how can we keep the 
product going even with the limited funding that we have available? If a key technology 
person leaves the company, the CTO is the one who has to find a solution so that the 
product development itself does not slow down because it's a race to find the minimum 
viable  product,  it's  a  race  to  find  the  first  customer,  it's  a  race  to  find  the  second 
customer. That's the key to success in a startup. 

The CTO also has to be committed to finding a culture that works. Remember, we said 
the culture of a startup is frenzied, chaotic and ad hoc. It can burn people out. So, along 
with the CEO, sometimes the CTO has an important role in lifting the morale, keeps the 
troops going and those are important elements. So, what does the CTO do in a startup? 
We can say a role in minimum viable product development, a role in improving the user 
experience,  in  overseeing  the  application  architecture,  in  enhancing  the  vendor  and 
customer  relationships  and  in  talent  management.  So,  that's  what  a  CTO  does  in  a 
startup.

Video 8: CTO: Role in Mid and Large Firms 

What does the CTO do in a midsize firm?  Unlike a startup, in a midsize firm, the CTO 
has fewer hats to wear because there are more people. There is more differentiation 
and  specialisation.  There  is  somebody  doing  marketing,  there's  somebody  doing 
manufacturing, there's somebody doing customer relationships. So, the CTO has fewer 
hats to wear, but now has to be more collaborative as a member of the team. The CTO 
in a midsized organisation is a creator and overseer of the technology strategy. He or 
she envisions how technology will be used and how do we implement new technologies. 
The CTO will increase the maturity of the technology processes because now you need 
to go from ad hoc to less chaotic, ad hoc to more organised structure and process. So, 
the  CTO  moves  from  being  more  hands-on  in  a  startup  to  being  less  hands-on  and 
being more of an enabler of teams, culture and methodologies.  

The CTO's role becomes one, about building a larger team and formalising roles. For 
example,  building  a  cloud  team,  building  an  analytics  team,  building  a  mobility  team 
because you need to attract more talent and create very much distinct roles so that their 
identities are clear but at the same time encourage collaboration so that they can work 
together. So, building a team is very important. Rather than having a deep knowledge 
in every aspect, the CTO becomes more of a big picture thinker who can articulate a 
global vision and translate that into specific projects or technology initiatives. The CTO 
needs to have a good understanding of what is urgent versus what is important.   

What about a large firm? In a large firm, there is more specialisation, there are more 
people doing specialised roles. So, in that company, the role of a CTO becomes more 
of  an  evangelist  and  a  strategic  thinker.  The  CTO  still  sets  the  strategy,  culture  and 
technology direction, but is more focused on future proofing the business, meaning that 
we are doing well today, what are the shocks, what are the trends that we should be 
vigilant about and how will the business change and how do we position the business 
to change before it becomes irrelevant or before a competitor makes us obsolete. Here, 
a CTO is more of a charismatic visionary. He or she is a spokesperson and very much 
an integral member of the leadership team, very much a member of the board, helping 
connect to the leaders of other companies in the same industry, in tech companies. So, 
you can see the variation of  a CTO role from a startup to a medium sized company to 
a large firm.   

Video 9: Skills of a CTO 

What are the skills of a CTO? By now it should be clear that there are a core set of skills 
that define a CTO. What are they? First, strategic thinking. A CTO must be able to see 
the  big  picture  about  business  and  technology  direction,  understand  the  industry, 
understand the firm's competitive strategy and how technology and strategy can blend 
together  and  help  educate  the  leadership  by  being  a  member  of  team  in  strategic 
thinking, envisioning the future, envisioning the future direction of product services and 
customer  offerings,  envisioning  future  business  models.  Second  important  skill  is 
innovation catalyst. Finding those sweet spots of opportunity as technology trends and 
business  needs  collide.  How  can  we  enhance  customer  relationships?  How  can  we 
improve operations? So, for example, Starbucks. Starbucks' success in enriching the

customer interface through an omnichannel, through apps, through rewards programs, 
these are all examples of innovation around enriching the customer experience. CTO 
has to be a catalyst in that innovation. Or if you are an automobile company like Maruti, 
how can you use technology to streamline supply chain? To make supply chain more 
flexible,  adaptive  and  less  costly?  That's  an  innovation  opportunity.  So,  those  are 
examples of a CTO conducting their role as an innovation catalyst. A third important 
skill is cross-functional acumen. The ability to marry technology to business means a 
CTO  must  be  understanding  of  the  connections  between  marketing,  supply  chain, 
manufacturing, operations, warehousing, aftersales service, because the fundamental 
key to success in a digital economy is cross-disciplinary innovation. So, the ability to 
think  across  boundaries  of  these  functional  silos,  and  then  how  do  you  apply 
technology? That's what we mean as the cross-functional acumen. 

The  CTO  must  have  the  skill  of  being  a  continuous  learner.  This  is  one  role  where 
learning never stops because there are new technologies, new ideas and potentially 
disruption. The CTO ensures that the firm doesn't stand in its own place, doesn't bask 
in the glory of its recent success, because you start thinking about what next. So, the 
CTO themselves must be a continuous learner. Learning from customers, learning from 
vendors,  learning  from  colleagues  and  processing  that  learning  into  the  next  idea. 
Another important skill; communication. As an enabler, as an orchestrator, as a team 
player, collaborator, if you can communicate, you cannot be effective as a CTO. So, 
learning  how  to  communicate  with  customers,  how  to  communicate  with  internal 
colleagues, how to communicate with employees, how to communicate with investors, 
how to communicate with the public, subtly different. Today we have various means of 
communication.  We  have  internal  communication;  we  have  channels  such  as  Slack. 
Then there are social media communication. So, understanding the role and relevance 
of different communication media and different messages is an important element of 
the communication skill. 

People  management,  another  important  skill  because  fundamentally,  as  you  have 
observed, in their evolution from a startup to a medium to large company, one of the 
key transitions a CTO goes through is from being a force of one to being an enabler of 
people,  acquiring  talent,  retaining  talent,  motivating  talent  in  the  face  of  a  battle  for 
talent. So, people management skill is a very important skill. Last but not least, digital 
acumen. We already talked about cross-functional acumen. So, digital acumen is the 
ability  to  understand  the  evolution  of  technology,  the  ability  to  understand  the 
implications of that for product, process and operations is called digital acumen. Digital 
acumen is also the ability to translate those ideas in a way that can be understood by 
others.  So,  we  can  summarise  the  skills once  again as  strategic thinking,  innovation 
catalyst, cross-functional acumen, continuous learning, people management and digital 
acumen.

Video 10: Module Summary 

So, we have talked about different ways of introducing the role of the CTO. Who is the 
CTO?   

How  is the  role  of  a  CTO  different  from that of  a  CIO?  How  is a  CTO  role  changing 
across organisations? So, what's the future of the CTO? The future of the CTO is in 
marrying the power of people with the power of technology, and that potential is infinite. 
As new advances in technology are embraced, there will be new roles and new skills to 
learn,  new  ways  of  thinking,  and  the  leaders  will  need  to  guide  their  people  through 
these  changes.  Motivating  them,  and  when  necessary,  quashing  the  fears  of  the 
unknown. As companies scale, so does the role of the CTO. They will need to focus 
more and more on developing the potential of their people, moving away from purely 
technical  and  toward  how  people  and  teams  can  work  together  for  the  good  of  the 
business.
