ISB CTO  
Week 5: CTO as Technology Architect 

Video 1: Module Overview 

• 

In the digital economy, firms must simultaneously address customer experience and 
operational synchronisation. 

•  Balancing open innovation with the ability to commercialise new ideas is crucial. 
•  Building a robust technology platform is essential for scaling and launching good ideas. 
•  Experimentation should be supported by suitable platforms that enable scaling and 

accelerated learning. 

•  As a technology architect the CTO’s role involves translating business strategy into 
technology strategy and aligning technology with business priorities and challenges. 

Video 2: Digital Economy: Business Imperatives 

•  Speed to market is crucial in the digital economy to stay competitive. 
•  Providing seamless multichannel experiences enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
•  Utilising big data and advanced analytics enables better understanding of customer 

behaviour. 

•  Automating operations and digitising business processes improves responsiveness and 

efficiency. 

Video 3: Digital Economy: Technology Imperatives  

•  Establishing an enhanced web presence is crucial for businesses in the digital economy. 
•  Managing the complexity of app infrastructure requires API development and integrated 

access to content. 

•  Enterprise platforms like ERP, CRM, and SCM serve as backends for app infrastructure. 
•  Effective data warehousing and analytics platforms are essential for informed decision-

making. 

•  Cloud platforms play a significant role in modern business infrastructure. 
•  Digital marketing and collaboration tools are vital for effective communication and workflow 

management. 

•  The CTO plays a crucial role in understanding, integrating, and predicting technological 

advancements. 

Video 4: Assembling the Digital Infrastructure 

•  As a technology architect the CTO uses the digital infrastructure framework. 
•  The framework identifies five ways of assembling the digital infrastructure. 

o  Operational backbone for operational efficiency, productivity, and reliability. 
o  Shared customer insights for generating and sharing customer knowledge. 
o  Digital platform as a repository of business, technology, and data components. 
o  External developer platform for external orientation and open innovation. 
o  Governance framework for decision-making and accountability. 

Video 5: The Digital Infrastructure 

•  The operational backbone supports seamless transaction processing and automates 

business processes. 

•  The digital platform embraces a component-based architecture and serves as a repository of 

reusable components.

•  The external developer platform fosters open innovation and engages external partners 

through APIs. 

•  Shared customer insights stem from continuous experimentation, co-creation, and effective 

knowledge sharing. 

•  The governance framework establishes clear accountabilities and decision-making processes 

within the digital infrastructure. 

Video 6: The Technology Strategy 

•  Synchronising business and technology strategies is essential for effective technology 

investments. 

•  Twin speed architecture balances a slow-moving backend with a fast, customer-centric 

frontend. 

•  Embracing microservices enables agility and modularity in the digital infrastructure. 
•  Zero downtime implementation ensures seamless upgrades and minimal disruption. 
•  Real-time data analytics enhance decision-making and customer experiences. 
•  Robust security measures protect valuable data and ensure regulatory compliance. 
•  Developing a comprehensive technology strategy assures high performance across these 

dimensions. 

Video 7: Developing a Two-Speed Architecture  

•  Develop a hybrid target architecture that accommodates both fast-speed frontend and slow-

speed backend systems. 

•  Blend agile and waterfall methodologies to leverage the benefits of both approaches. 
•  Pay attention to the development and maintenance of the low-speed backend architecture to 

support frontend applications effectively. 

•  View technology investments as capital expenditures to prioritise strategic decision-making 

and long-term planning. 

•  Manage change at multiple levels simultaneously, addressing immediate needs while 

optimising integration and infrastructure for medium and long-term goals. 

Video 8: Action Plan for a CTO 

•  Developing a technology infrastructure strategy is essential for a CTO. 
•  Orchestration of the technology ecosystem involves engaging with vendors, consultants, and 

app developers. 

•  Balancing the financial and strategic business case is crucial when making technology 

investment decisions. 

•  Continuous research and development activities help the CTO stay informed about emerging 

technologies. 

•  Building and managing the human capital infrastructure is vital to ensure a skilled and 

productive technical workforce. 

Video 9: Module Summary  

•  Developing a technology strategy that balances scalability and experiments is vital. 
•  Embracing paradoxes and finding ways to simultaneously be open and flexible, yet robust 

and protected, is crucial. 

•  The two-speed architecture provides a framework for blending fast front-end platforms with 

deliberate back-end platforms. 

•  The CTO plays a critical role in synchronising business, digital innovation, and technology 

strategies.
