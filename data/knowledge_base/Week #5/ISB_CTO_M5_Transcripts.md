Week 5: CTO as a Technology Architect  

Video 1: Module Overview   

Another  important  role  and  skill  that  makes  a  chief  technology  officer  invaluable  in 
today's digital economy context is their role as a technology architect. In this module, 
we will understand why is that function, or why is that role so indispensable today, and 
then we'll talk about what kind of frameworks, what kind of knowledge and skills you 
should cultivate to be effective in your role as a technology architect. So, let's start by 
talking  about  the  strategic  context  today.  In  today's  digital  economy,  firms  must 
simultaneously  implement  strategies  for  customising  products  and  services.  For  the 
customer  experience,  all  the  things  we've  talked  about  on  enriching  the  customer 
interface,  but  do them  simultaneously with  synchronising  operations.  In  other words, 
firms don't have the luxury of doing one or the other, customer or the operations, they 
have  to  do  all  of  them  which  means  that  the  scale  is  much  larger.  Firms  must  also 
balance open innovation with the ability to commercialise new product ideas. In other 
words, open innovation generates ideas, but then how do you sift and winnow those 
ideas? How do you build a robust platform to launch the good ideas, and how do you 
scale them up? Because remember, we said today the focus is on winner-take-all. If 
you remember from an earlier discussion of strategy catalyst, the new real rules of the 
game are scale, speed and scope. So, what kind of a technology platform do you need 
in order to commercialise the good ideas at scale and with speed? Third, firms must 
balance the ability to experiment with the ability to scale successful ideas. What kind of 
platforms do you build in order to support experimentation? One of the important metrics 
we said is not one or two experiments, but tens, maybe even 100 experiments in a year, 
or  for  some  companies,  100  experiments  every  six  months.  So,  what  kind  of  a 
technology platform do you need in order to scale experiments and speed them up and 
at the same time learn from the successful ideas and bring them to market? So, what 
does that mean for the role of a Chief Technology Architect? Questions such as, what 
digital infrastructure do we need? How do we weave together different technologies? 
That  they  be  ERP,  data  warehouse,  mobility,  smart,  cloud,  analytics  and  the  list  of 
technologies keeps growing, virtual reality, augmented reality, AI. So, how do we make 
sense of all these technologies and build the platform for our company? So, the role of 
a Chief Technology Officer as a technology architect is important to make sense of the 
technologies,  to  make  sense  of  the  business  priorities  and  challenges  and  to  marry 
them together. And that's what we mean by the technology architect  role, translating 
business strategy into technology strategy and then leveraging technology strategy for 
new business strategy.

Video 2: Digital Economy: Business Imperatives 

So, what are the business imperatives?  

Imperative  means  pressure,  need.  What  are  the  business  imperatives  in  a  digital 
economy  that  are  influencing  the  need  for  technology  and  the  role  of  a  CTO  as  a 
technology architect? First, speed, speed, speed, in other words, faster time to market 
with  new  offerings  is  an  absolute  necessity.  Second,  seamless  multichannel 
experiences.  Blending  the  physical  and  the  digital,  so  that  customers  can  move 
effortlessly from one channel to the other, and put the customer as the centre of the 
choice in those decisions. Third, how firms can use big data and advanced analytics to 
better understand customer behaviour, that's a necessity today. And fourth, firms need 
to improve their capabilities to automate operations, to digitise business processes, so 
that they can have quicker response times to customers while at the same time cutting 
cost  and  waste  and  improving  productivity.  Gone  are  the  days  of  saying  we  either 
reduce cost or improve our speed or enrich our customer offerings. Today the need is 
to do all of them, and how can you do them smartly through business processes, but 
importantly through technology? So, those are the challenges facing businesses today 
as drivers on the digital economy. 

Video 3: Digital Economy: Technology Imperatives 

Beyond the business imperatives, there are technology imperatives too. The IT industry, 
or the digital products and services industry over the last 20 plus years has been most 
dramatic in terms of the scale, the rapidity, and the frequency of innovation. Just think 
back about some of the products and services that are becoming household names like 
augmented  reality,  virtual  reality.  You  see  that  on  your  smartphone.  Five  years ago, 
they were just concepts. So, 10 years ago, smartphones were just emerging, and today 
they have become very much a reality. So, the digital products and services industry 
continually expands, grows, and innovates at a rapid speed. That's the good news. The 
challenging  news  is  for  most  firms,  whether  they  are  in  retail,  education,  financial 
services, name the industry, which are the users of this technology, how do they stay 
on top of this growing list of technologies? How do they make sense of them? So, today, 
the list of technologies continues to grow and create challenges in understanding them.  

So,  what  are  some  of  the  technology  imperatives  today  for  the  digital  economy?  
Enhanced  web  presence.  Can  you  think  of  a  business  which  doesn't  have  a  web 
presence?  It  means  mastering  content  management,  mastering  personalisation,  and 
identity  management, important  elements of web  presence. Add  to  that, the  growing 
complexity  of  the  app’s  infrastructure.  Where  you  need  to  build  APIs,  Application 
Program Interfaces, you need to provide integrated access to content. After all, an app 
is your identity. Who are you? Your services? What do you want? How you will procure 
the  services,  your payments,  and  your protection?  Meaning  that how do  you protect 
security and privacy? Bundle all that. So, next time you look at an app, imagine how 
much complexity and richness goes into designing that app. And apps typically have a 
useful life of six months before they're replaced with a new app. So, just think about the 
scale and the speed of that world that companies have to venture into.   

 ISB CTO

Then, of course, there is the backbone which is the ERP, Enterprise Resource Planning, 
CRM, Customer Relationship Management, Seller Relationship Management, Supply 
Chain  Management.  We  call  these  the  enterprise  platform  that  are  an  important 
backend  to  the  app’s  infrastructure.  Later  on,  we'll  talk  about  how do  you  build  both 
these infrastructures simultaneously, which is a vastly new challenge.  

Add to that, building and managing a data warehouse and an analytics platform. On top 
of that security platform, today security is a key issue, and the firms can be penalised 
for violating the security promise, the privacy promise.   

The  cloud  platform.  Cloud  is  the  new  technology  and  business  infrastructure  for 
business,  so  managing  cloud  platforms.  And  then,  of  course,  digital  marketing  and 
Office  collaboration  tools.  Every  few  days,  Microsoft  announces  new  innovations  in 
teams, which one of the newest Office collaboration tools. How do you integrate that 
into your Office processes?   

So, you can see the list of technologies continues to grow and those are the technology 
imperatives for a company. They rely upon the Chief Technology Officer to know what's 
new; how do we make sense of it, how do we marry them with what is existing, and 
then to predict what else is going to be happening in the future. Very important elements 
of the technology architect role that we will explore. 

Video 4: Assembling the Digital Infrastructure 

So,  in  thinking  about  the  digital  infrastructure,  is  there  a  way  to  identify  the  different 
components? Can we develop a framework so that we can systematically understand 
what does it mean to be a technology architect? 

Some of the work done by professors at MIT, Jeanne Ross, Martin Mocker, and Cynthia 
Beath is helpful in this regard, where they've studied a lot of companies, and how do 
they build their digital infrastructure. 

So, what are the five ways of assembling the digital infrastructure? The first area is the 
operational backbone. Typically, these are the integrated systems and processes that 
ensure  operational  efficiency,  productivity,  and  reliability,  particularly 
in  how 
transactions are executed. Today, that means fundamentally re-engineering business 
processes and digitising them through enterprise systems. We'll talk more about that in 
detail later.  

A second area of the digital infrastructure is shared customer insights. Remember, we 
said  that  in  the  digital reality  is smart, mobility,  analytics,  cloud. So,  lot  of  it  is about 
generating  insights,  particularly  customer  insights  and  sharing  them  across  the 
organisation. So, this layer of the infrastructure is: how do you generate organisational 
knowledge about what customers like, what will they pay, how much will they pay, and 
how  digital  technologies  can  be  used  to  harvest  those  insights  and  put  them  to 
operational use.  

A third area is the digital platform. This is a repository of business, technology, and data 
components. This is where a new trend called components-based architecture. In other 
words, components are modules of business processes, data, and technology woven 

 ISB CTO 

3  

 
   
  
  
together. So, digital platform is a repository of these components which facilitates rapid 
innovation and growth, and particularly helps in creating new offerings in a rapid and a 
quick cycle time fashion.  

The fourth area is the external developer platform. Remember we said, one of the key 
challenges today in a digital economy is, reimagine business around the customer. So, 
how  do  you  provide  external  orientation  toward  the  customer?  And  that's  what  an 
external developer platform is, particularly from an open innovation point of view. So, 
an external developer platform is a digital platform for an ecosystem of partners who 
contribute to innovation, different ideas. 

And then the final piece is what we call a governance framework. How do you make 
decisions? We call that the accountability framework. Decision rights and decision rules 
about who will make specific decisions. So, these are the five components. And as a 
technology architect, this framework helps a CTO systematically address each of the 
five layers and assess whether they have been completely addressed or not.  

Video 5: The Digital Infrastructure 

Now, let's dig deeper into the components of the digital infrastructure. You will recall we 
said there are five key areas, so let's dig into each of these areas to understand what 
kind of decisions need to be made. So, let's start with the operational backbone. Think 
about  this  as  the  platform  built  around  Enterprise  Resource  Systems,  ERP,  Supply 
Chain Management, CRM, a suite of technologies called enterprise systems and the 
data warehouse.  

What's the objective of an operational backbone? It is to support seamless end-to-end 
transaction  processing.  It's  also  to  provide  visibility  into  the  transactions,  their 
timeliness,  their  reliability,  how well they  were  done,  were  they done  with  security  in 
mind? So, the quality of transaction execution is important. The goal is also to automate 
repetitive  business processes  so  that  they  can  be executed  reliably and  with  speed. 
And the goal of the operational backbone is to provide a single source of truth, meaning 
data  that  you  can  trust,  streamlining  all  the  data  and  embedding  that  into  a  data 
warehouse.  

So,  once  again  as  I  said  before,  very  much  a  focus  on  business  processes  and 
enterprise systems and data to provide the backbone for the organisation. The digital 
platform is the second dimension that complements the operational backbone. Think 
about this as the component-based architecture. What are components? Components 
are specific business processes designed with data and technology in mind. They have 
service rules, so for example a component could be, product pricing. So, it a business 
process with some rules of product pricing, data, and technology. So, this is how firms 
are  building  a  modular  set  of  products  and  applications  on  top  of  the  enterprise 
backbone. The goal of the digital platform is to provide a repository of reusable technical 
components.  Additionally,  to  provide  a  repository  of  reusable  business  components. 
So, product pricing is a business component whereas security, identity management, 
those are examples of technical components which can be reused in different ways.  

 ISB CTO 

4  

 
   
  
  
The goal of a digital platform is also to provide data repositories and tools for analytics. 
It also provides linkages to core data and processes in the operational backbone. In 
other words, the operational backbone stores the data and then extracts of the data are 
drawn into the digital platform for particular uses. So, a customer relationship manager 
does  not  need  to  see the  entire  data,  but  depending  on  their  rule and  their  decision 
responsibilities, they get to see a view of data that's relevant to them. So, that's what 
we mean by drawing data from the operational backbone into the digital platform. And 
then, of course, managing the continuous release of new components. So, there might 
be  new  components  for  redesigning  customer  segmentation,  product  positioning, 
channel management. So, every time there are changes they need to be, re-embedded 
into the digital platform. So, the operational backbone plus digital platform. The third 
one, and this is the new part of today's digital economy which is the external developer 
platform.  In  an  open  innovation  manner,  employees,  customers,  suppliers,  all  are 
sources of apps in an open innovation manner. 

So,  what's  important  is  the  external  developer  platform  creates  APIs  or  application 
program interfaces. These are hooks or these are rules which the firm publishes openly 
so that anybody can write an application and connect to the platform. So, APIs are a 
reality of today's world to provide flexibility, modularity, and open innovation. So, making 
the APIs available to external partners, what are the rules? How will you include external 
partners in your enterprise digital platform? Publishing a catalogue of services available 
in the digital platform so that outside developers can write code according to that. And 
the  role  of  an  external  developer  platform  is  to  rapidly  onboard  new  partners. 
Remember  when  we  talked  about  strategy  catalyst  in  Module  2,  we  said,  open 
innovation,  building  new  ecosystems,  which  means  finding  new  partners  and 
onboarding them rapidly. So, from a technology perspective, the quality of the external 
developer  platform  is  the  key  to  that  success.  The  fourth  dimension  are  the  shared 
customer  insights.  Think  about  this  as  the  investment  in  analytics,  AI,  and  machine 
learning technologies, that's the layer that we call the shared customer insights. 

What  are  some  of  the  things  we  should  know  about  this  layer?  Shared  customer 
insights, they stem from a constant flow of experiments. Remember we said how many 
experiments do you do is a key to success in digital economy. So, the data generated 
from experiments that help identify what customers value. The shared customer insights 
are also based upon, experiments with new technologies such as wearables. They are 
guided by a  vision that  targets  the  customer value proposition, meaning,  what  is the 
customer value? so if it is product innovation, then this is how you keep testing new 
products. 

The  shared  insights  are  enhanced  by  tightly  integrated  sales,  service  and  product 
development processes. So, re-engineering them to make sure that they work together, 
something  that's  a  challenge  in  traditional  organisations.  Shared  insights  are  also 
developed  through  a  co-creation  process.  We  used  that  word  before  to  say  that  the 
customer is not the end target, but the customer is a partner, co-creator in your product 
or  offering.  And  then  shared  insights  also  have  to  build  mechanisms  for,  sharing 
learning  from  every  encounter,  so  capturing  that  knowledge.  So,  the  key  to  success 
here is, are you capturing new insights, are you sharing them across the organisation 

 ISB CTO 

5  

 
   
  
  
for  reuse  and  deployment,  and  how  well  are  you  curating  the  accuracy  and  the 
authenticity of  the  knowledge?  You  will  notice  that  as  we move  from  the operational 
backbone  to  this,  the  kind  of  things  you  do  start  changing.  That's  what  makes 
assembling the digital infrastructure so complex.  

 And then the final piece is the governance framework. Who has responsibility for the 
operational  backbone?  Who  has  responsibility  for  the  digital  platform?  Who  has 
responsibility  for  shared  insights?  Who  has  responsibility  for  the  external  developer 
platform? The mistake firms often make is not having clear rights and responsibilities 
and  an  accountability  framework,  so  developing  that  is  also  important.  Clear 
accountabilities  enable  a  high  degree  of  autonomy,  but  at  the  same  time  they  build 
coordination across the decisions so that they are not incompatible with each other. An 
accountability framework also helps  identify  metrics  of  success  which  you  can  track. 
So,  this  involves  decisions  about  what  decisions  will  be  made  by  the  CTO,  what 
decisions will be made by the CIO, and what decisions will be made by the business 
units? So, to summarise, the enterprise or the operational backbone, external developer 
platform,  digital  platform,  shared  customer  insights,  accountability  framework;  five 
different dimensions of how you systematically build a digital infrastructure.  

Video 6: The Technology Strategy 

The role of a CTO as a technology architect goes beyond developing the digital platform 
or  the  digital  infrastructure  to  developing  the  technology  strategy.  The  technology 
strategy  is  a  blueprint  of  how  will  you  translate  the  business  strategy  into  a  set  of 
investments  in  technologies,  and  how  will  those  technology  investments  support  the 
business  strategy.  So,  we  call  it  synchronising  business  strategy  and  technology 
strategy. You will remember, when we talked about the business imperatives, we said, 
the challenge for companies today is to be both productive, efficient and reliable but at 
the same time open, flexible, innovative and customer-oriented. So, the challenge today 
is,  how  do  you  simultaneously  embed  flexibility  and  rigidity,  openness  and  secrecy, 
modularity and reliability into the same technology infrastructure?  

So, new ideas from Gartner, advocate for what we call a twin speed architecture and 
technology strategy. What does the twin speed mean? Simply put, it means that the 
backend moves slowly, it should, but as the frontend should move very fast. So, how 
do you take two gears, one moving at light speed on the customer side and the other 
one  moving  slowly  and  methodically  on  the  operational  side?  So,  a  twin  speed 
architecture  recognises  the  need  to  simultaneously  build  foundational  business 
processes and technology platforms where the goals are resiliency, security, integrity, 
quality  and  regulatory compliance,  and,  on  the  other hand,  to  build  a different  set  of 
business processes, what we call the frontend processes and technology platforms for 
speed, flexibility and agility. So, another way of looking at the twin speed architecture 
is to describe this as a fast speed, customer-centric frontend running along with a slow 
speed, transaction-focused foundation. That's a challenge, but that's what is needed. 
The customer facing parts of the digital platform should be modular so that you can do 
quick  deployment  of  new  software  by  avoiding  time-consuming  integration  work. 
Sometimes  when  you do  this,  you're  making  imperfect  technology solutions,  and  we 

 ISB CTO 

6  

 
   
  
  
call  that  you're  incurring  technical  debt,  meaning  it's  not  perfect,  but  speed  trumps 
perfection. And at the same time, the transactional core systems must be designed for 
stability, high-quality data management which means longer release cycle times. So, I 
hope  you  see  the  contradiction.  At  the  frontend,  quick  deployment,  whereas  the 
backend, longer release cycle times. And both coexist in the technology strategy. And 
you  do  that  both  by  leveraging  partnerships  with  technology  vendors  and  systems 
integrators,  such  as  Accenture,  Infosys,  Wipro,  TCS.  On  the  other  hand,  you  also 
leverage open-source development and APIs. So, the role of a CTO as a technology 
catalyst has become much more challenging and complex  because in the old days, the 
focus mostly was on the backend, but now the backend is important but by itself is not 
sufficient. So, how do you build such a technology strategy? Here are some important 
dimensions of doing that.   

First, focus on microservices. Microservices are small amounts of functionality, such as 
customer product pricing. It's a part of a bigger marketing function, but it's a discrete 
activity.  So,  build  support  for  discrete  activities,  and  we  call  them  microservices. 
Similarly, enable, enabling digital payments by customers, that's only a part of the whole 
customer journey, but that's a specific microservice. You can build it fast, and you can 
deploy  it  fast.  So,  one  approach  is  to  define  microservices  with  small  amounts  of 
functionality,  such  as  looking  up  the  next  product  a  customer  would  most  likely 
purchase. These functionalities can be deployed very quickly, often within a few hours. 
They also rely upon open access to outside programmers and multiple programming 
languages rather than being locked into a single development framework. So, that's one 
important element, build microservices.   

A  second  criterion  or  a  goal  of  technology  strategy  is  zero  downtime.  In  the  digital 
economy, zero downtime is absolutely an imperative. So, upgrades of systems affecting 
consumer's experience should be seamless. They should not be able to notice that, that 
there's a disruption due to upgrades. The deployment of new software or service should 
be  in  parallel  with  the  existing  system and  a  gradual  cutover  to  the  new  software  or 
service.  There must be  fallback  mechanisms  in  case  things  go  wrong  so  that  issues 
arising in one service do not harm the overall operations more than necessary. So, zero 
downtime, another critical priority.   

A third element is real-time data analytics, the ability to analyse big data in real time 
and make analytics a part of the decision-making process. So, for example, the ability 
to analyse a customer's purchases automatically and deliver them a savings coupon for 
the  next  purchase  they  might  make  or  the  ability  to  recommend  the  next,  important 
product or service, even as they're completing the current purchase. So, that's what we 
call  analytics  in  real  time.  These  are  necessary  today.  And  so,  how  quick  and  how 
accurate, how reliable are your analytics? That's a third dimension.   

A  fourth  dimension  is  security.  Cybersecurity  must  be  an  integral  part  of  the  overall 
infrastructure today.  Not  only do  companies have more  valuable  data  to protect  and 
become more attractive to hackers, but the digital interface also opens up access to 
outside people like customers, suppliers and other partners. There's another important 
reason, which is regulatory compliance. Country after country are toughening up their 

 ISB CTO 

7  

 
   
  
  
rules to punish companies for losing data or exposing customer data to outside hackers. 
So,  secure  architecture 
to  summarise: 
microservices, zero downtime, real-time data analytics and a secure architecture, four 
important ways in which you measure how good is your digital infrastructure. And you 
develop a technology strategy to assure high levels of performance on all these four 
dimensions.  

important  dimension.  So, 

is  another 

Video 7: Developing a Two-Speed Architecture 

What are some principles in developing a two-speed architecture?  

One  fundamental  idea  to  grasp  is  for  a  very  long  time,  we  have  focused  upon  the 
traditional  systems  development  life  cycle  which  is  called  the  waterfall  model.  The 
waterfall  model  says  build  the  systems  deliberately  through  phases,  which  is  plan, 
design, build and test, and don't go from one phase to the other until you're completely 
done  with  the  specifications.  So,  take  a  retailer  like  Target.  Using  the  waterfall 
approach,  they  will  be  reengineering  their  core  business  processes,  such  as,  supply 
chain,  merchandising,  product  placement,  point  of  sale  counters.  So,  these  are 
examples of business processes and the waterfall model. The chief technology architect 
at, Target would essentially be very methodical and slow and deliberate, and the whole 
process might take, two years. The advantage of such an approach is it is systematic; 
it  is  disciplined,  and  it  is  comprehensive.  The  downside  is  it  is  slow  and  if  the 
requirements are changing rapidly, then the work has already become obsolete even 
before it has been launched, and that's a particularly acute problem at the customer 
interface.  

Remember  we  said,  there  is  the  external  platform  for  customers  and  suppliers.  So, 
where  the  waterfall  model  is  built  for  six  months,  one-year,  two-year  development 
cycles, we need something that is fast, flexible, and that's the agile methodology. So, 
at the frontend at the customer facing, you have to marry the backend waterfall with the 
frontend agile methods. Going back to the same example of Target, as Target starts 
building apps, as it starts building web-based interface for customers, to find stores, to 
find products, to order products, enable, omnichannel experience, the development of 
new  services  have  to  be  done  in  four  weeks,  not  six  months,  not  one  year,  not  two 
years. So, that's where the agile methodology becomes important because the focus is 
on just do enough, build it, deliver it and then six months later build something new. So, 
in a two-speed architecture, if we stick with the example of Target, their goal has to be 
how do you apply the waterfall development methodology for the backend and at the 
same  time  learn  how  to  do  agile  development  at  the  frontend.  So,  what  are  some 
principles in this regard for developing a two-speed architecture? First, manage a hybrid 
target architecture. What does that mean? It means that in the old days, there was a 
single  architecture,  the  operational  backend,  it  was  homogeneous.  Now  we  have 
heterogeneous architectures, one is at slow speed and deliberative, other one is at fast 
speed and modular and open.  

So, how do you develop your strategy or a target architecture where the transactional 
platforms  are  managed  for  scalability  and  resilience,  and  they  coexist  with  systems 
optimised  for  customer  experience?  Same  thing  happens  in  financial  services,  a 

 ISB CTO 

8  

 
   
  
  
backend in a bank, a backend infrastructure built for resilience, built for supporting ATM 
networks, built for supporting interbank transactions and built for high levels of security. 
But at the same time, in working with fintechs, the same banks have to focus on apps 
at the frontend using the agile development methodology. So, you get the picture of two 
different methodologies, a transactional platform optimised for scalability and resilience 
and the frontend platform optimised for customer experience. This two-speed strategy 
can only be sustained if there is a blueprint, a high-level target architecture, identifying 
what technologies and processes and who will have the responsibility for the frontend 
and similarly who will have responsibility for the backend and making sure that you're 
not missing. So, today's world, whether it be Target or whether it be a bank or a financial 
services  or  a  hospital.  Cybersecurity,  so  making  sure  that  you're  paying  attention  to 
security and you're describing it clearly from the beginning. One of the challenges is if 
you miss components in defining your architecture and you discover those gaps, you 
can get slowed down later. Second important element of the strategy is plan for ongoing 
software delivery with the blends of methodologies, again waterfall at the backend. So, 
sometimes there might not be the time because of urgency. If you remember in the last 
module  we  talked  about,  different  ways  in  which  you  think  about  your  innovation 
portfolio. Sometimes there are mandatory projects which have to be completed within 
a few weeks. So, there might not be time to apply the deliberative, methodical waterfall 
development  model.  So,  the  goal  must  be  to  develop  software  always  by  using  a 
waterfall model, but sometimes moving with speed and coming back and correcting any 
technical deficiencies later. So, sometimes it's okay to do parts without worrying about 
the whole because urgency might be important, and you come back and do that. Again, 
using  the  Target  example,  if  their  competitor  has  introduced  digital  payments,  then 
Target has to get that implemented in a week to two. So, it's a race to market, not waiting 
for perfection. But later on, they can come back and say, let's clean it up, let's build a 
better product while the customer still has something to work with. So, how do you blend 
the  benefits  of  agile,  which  is  iterative  development,  continuous  delivery,  into  the 
waterfall model? So, that's an important element of blending both agile and waterfall 
development  methods  into  your  strategy.  A  third  dimension  is,  developing  the  low-
speed architecture, which is the backend. You might be tempted to think that we should 
simply focus on apps because that's where the value created and move on. But if you 
neglect the backend, then suddenly you will find that you built all these frontend apps 
which don't work with each other, and they're getting slowed down because they are 
searching for data and searching for speed. So, you have to periodically go back and 
re-engineer the backend, the low-speed architecture. It's important to recognise from 
the beginning that both models are necessary. You may not be able to develop them 
simultaneously, but it's important to make sure that you are also intermittently stopping 
and cleaning up and developing the backend infrastructure and not continuously only 
focusing on the agile methodology and the frontend infrastructure. Another important 
element  is  to  build  that  change  mindset.  Technology  development  can  be  guilty  of 
saying, let's get it perfect. But when technology becomes a key factor for a company's 
competitiveness, management attention must be more focused on viewing technology 
as a capital investment, and this is important. Even today, many firms make the mistake 
of  treating  technology as  an  annual expense.  The  same  company is Target,  when  it 
invests in a store, it treats the investment in a store as a capital expenditure, whereas

if it looks at IT as an annual expense, then they're going to underinvest in technology. 
Technology is too strategic today to not elevate discussions about technology to the 
board level. So, while efficiency is important, IT for competitive advantage means, are 
you  talking  about  that  at  the  board  level?  Is  the  CEO  paying  attention  to  that?  That 
means the chief technology officer must be a member of the board and if he or she is 
not a member of the board, they must have regular access to the board. They must be 
called  in  to  periodically  educate  the  board  about  the  technology  choices.  And  the 
outcome of all of this is not to be scared by the massive amounts of money that's often 
needed for technology investment. That's why taking the capital expenditure mentality, 
where you can write off that expenditure over multiple years rather than as an annual 
expense,  that's  an  important  element  of  a  change  mindset  toward  technology 
investment. You will recall I said, in an ideal world, the firms wish they have the time to 
be slow and methodical about building the operational backbone. Target would love to 
spend  a  lot  of  time  redesigning  their  business  processes,  taking  care  of  security, 
transaction speed and reliability. But in a fast-moving world, that's a luxury. So, think 
about managing  change  in three  parallel streams.  At  the  first level,  speed  and  cycle 
time  build  applications  and  functionality  that  are  rapidly  needed  for  business  with 
urgency. So, use the agile method and build those apps, then step back and optimise 
the solutions through development methods to integrate them with the cloud and with 
the data so that those, apps that you built are not standalone. This is called the medium-
term approach, meaning that first move with speed in a few weeks, then come back 
and integrate those apps into your cloud and data platforms. Sometimes that might take 
maybe,  a  few  months.  Then  come  back  and  connect  it  with  your  infrastructure. 
Sometimes that might take one year, it's a longer-term investment. So, to manage the 
paradox  of  reliability  and  scalability  with  speed  and  modularity,  in  reality  the  chief 
technology  officer can  play  the  role  of  a  technology  architect by  saying, I'm going  to 
really manage change at three levels. At one level, I will be rapidly responsive to the 
market, but in the background I will continually make sure that we are cleaning up the 
technical debt. Technical debt is when you start building applications with speed without 
worrying about how connected they are to the cloud platform, to the security platform 
and to the database. Over time the app starts slowing down. So, running the change in 
three parallel levels is very important. So, to summarise, in thinking about the two-speed 
architecture, focus upon defining what is the target architecture, how will you blend agile 
and  the  waterfall  method,  what  will  be  your backend  architecture,  how  will  you  treat 
technology as a capital expenditure, not as an annual expense, and then how will you 
think about managing change in three parallel ways. Those are some important ways 
in which a chief technology officer can become invaluable to the senior leadership in an 
organisation.  

Video 8: Action Plan for a CTO 

So, now that we've talked about how do you build a technology architecture, we talked 
about  the  five  different  components,  we  talked  about  the  process  of  a  two-speed 
architecture and change management, what are some skills and qualities that a CTO 
must have as a technology architect?

First, they must have the expertise for developing a technology infrastructure strategy, 
articulating the two-speed architecture, defining the components, and researching the 
best knowledge and partnerships available so that you are not just learning from inside 
but  also  learning  from  outside.  So,  how  do  you  develop  a  technology  infrastructure 
strategy?   

Second,  element  of  the  CTO  as  a  technology  architect  is  how  do  you  orchestrate  a 
technology  ecosystem?  Who  are  the  technology  vendors,  who  are  the  consultants? 
How do you bring them together? Both for the high-speed frontend and the low-speed 
backend, how do you learn about the best practices? As new technologies come up on 
the horizon, how do you learn what Accenture, what Infosys, what Wipro are doing in 
their labs, and how is that knowledge transferable into your organisation? How do you 
orchestrate app developers and encourage them to develop apps for your organisation? 
So, that's what we mean, orchestrate the technology ecosystem.   

A third important dimension is how do you make the business case for infrastructure 
and  technology  investments?  Organisations  are  comfortable  viewing  this  from  a 
financial investment lens, and then earlier I said, there the focus is, can we afford to 
make this investment? It's very rigorous, it's very conservative and very often it doesn't 
work well for technology investments, which are large in nature and the benefits are not 
easy to measure. So, the ability of the CTO to marry the financial case with the strategic 
case such as we need to do this because this is an investment in learning, we need to 
do this because this will be the source of competitive advantage, we need to do this 
because this is the new technology frontier. So, how does the CTO balance the financial 
case and the strategic business case to help the Board and the CEO understand the 
strategic importance of technology investments.   

The fourth area of a CTO's responsibility is R&D. How does the CTO continually scan, 
read stories, read scientific reports, go to vendor conferences to learn about what are 
the  new  technologies  that  are  emerging?  What  are  the  use  cases  for  these 
technologies, and when should we experiment with these technologies? And the final 
element  is  how  do  you  build  the  human  capital  infrastructure?  Technology  talent  is 
scarce,  it  is expensive.  So,  hiring,  retention, development,  deployment,  these are  all 
important  dimensions  of  the  human  capital  infrastructure,  and  so  managing  the 
technical talent is also an important responsibility.  

So,  to  summarise,  developing  the  technology  strategy,  developing  the  technology 
ecosystem,  developing  the  business  case  for  investments,  scanning  about  new 
technologies  and  developing  R&D  and  insights,  and  building  the  human  capital 
infrastructure, five important areas of responsibility that define the role of a CTO as a 
technology architect and as a key member of the top management team in most firms 
today.

Video 9: Module Summary  

In  reviewing  the  variety  of  concepts  that  we  discussed  in  this  module,  in  order  to 
enhance  your  knowledge  and  insight  about  CTO  as  a  technology  architect,  we,  let's 
reflect  upon  the  key  lessons  learned.  They  are  as  follows.  First,  business  and 
technology imperatives challenge firms. Today, to develop a technology strategy that is 
both  scalable,  but  amenable  to  experiments.  Scalable  for  reliability,  productivity  and 
security. Experiments for fast cycle time and customer responsiveness, whether it be 
Target as a retailer or whether it be an automotive manufacturer like Maruti or it might 
be a bank, it might be a hospital, they all are finding it important to do both. Similarly, 
remaining open and flexible, but at the same time robust and protected. We talked about 
this a few times. And third agile, but deliberative. So, these are what we call traditional 
paradoxes, meaning that companies usually did this or that, but today, the challenge of 
a digital economy is simultaneously doing both.  

So, how do you handle these paradoxes? We developed ideas about the two-speed 
architecture as a way to blend fast, flexible and open front end with deliberative, robust, 
scalable and secure back-end platforms. That's the challenge, but that's the role of a 
CTO as a technology, uh, architect. As a technology architect, the CTO must  be in a 
unique position to synchronise the business strategy, the digital innovation sweet spots 
and  the  technology  strategy.  In  a  way,  you  can  see  the  different  concepts  that  we 
discussed across the various modules come together into the role of a CTO and that's 
what makes the role of a CTO exciting as a career choice as an area of growth in most 
organisations today.
