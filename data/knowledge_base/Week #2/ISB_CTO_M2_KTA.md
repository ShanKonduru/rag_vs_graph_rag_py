•  Aspiring CTOs need to acquire knowledge about the digital economy. 
• 
It is vital to understand new digital ecosystems and partnerships. 
•  Familiarity with competitive moves is necessary for success in the digital landscape. 

Video 2: Digital Economy  

•  The digital economy is characterised by the increasing prominence of various technologies, 

such as cloud computing, social media, and the Internet of Things (IoT). 
•  Cloud computing plays a vital role in facilitating connectivity and data storage. 
•  Social media technologies have created opportunities for social commerce. 
•  Platforms for content, commerce, and connection foster collaboration between companies.

economy. 

•  The digital economy continues to evolve with the introduction of new innovations, such as 

wearables. 

Video 3: Drivers of Digital Economy  

•  Moore's law predicts the doubling of computing capacity every 18 months, leading to 

exponential growth in computing power. 

•  Metcalfe's law demonstrates the exponential increase in connections and the value derived 

from networks. 

•  The bandwidth law highlights the liberation of data transmission, enabling the seamless 

transfer of multimedia content. 

•  These laws serve as drivers of the ongoing digital transformation, enabling the rise of social 

media, mobile devices, analytics, cloud computing and the Internet of Things. 
•  AI computing, which is an extension of these laws, indicate that computing power, 

connections and storage capacity will continue to grow, providing more opportunities in the 
future. 

Video 4: Digital Economy: First Wave  

•  The first wave consisted of foundational technologies: social, mobile, analytics and cloud. 
•  Social technologies fostered social media engagement and customer communities, 

influencing purchasing decisions through word-of-mouth. 

•  Mobile technologies created opportunities for micro-moments, collaboration and omnichannel 

experiences. 

•  Analytics empowers businesses to gain insights and optimise marketing strategies. 
•  The cloud enables agility and customer-centric approaches, leading to product innovation and 

enhanced customer relationships. 

Video 5: Digital Economy: Second Wave  

•  The second wave introduced the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting physical devices and 

artifacts to the digital realm. 

•  The second wave enabled people-to-object and object-to-object connections, expanding the 

possibilities for innovation.

into consumer sentiment. 

•  Mobile apps and cloud computing redefine the customer interface, offering personalised 

information and convenient services. 

•  The Internet of Things connects products, enabling advanced functionalities and improved 

customer experiences. 

•  Robotics, drones, and 3D technologies disrupt supply chain operations and redefine order 

fulfillment. 

•  Augmented and virtual reality technologies enhance customer interactions and revolutionise 

product discovery. 

•  CTOs play a crucial role as strategy and innovation catalysts, bridging technology knowledge 

with business strategy. 

Video 7: Competing in the Digital Economy  

• 

In the digital economy, scale is essential as it enables companies to gain market dominance 
and valuable customer insights. 

•  Digital giants compete across multiple industries, lowering barriers to entry and challenging 

traditional players. 

•  Speed is crucial for success, with agility and continuous innovation as key drivers. 
•  Embracing customer feedback, open innovation, and experimentation are vital for staying 

competitive. 

•  Traditional companies must shift their mindset and aim for scale, scope, and speed 

simultaneously to thrive in the digital economy. 

Video 8: Defining Business Strategy  

•  Scale is essential for achieving market dominance and gaining valuable customer insights. 
•  Digital companies compete across multiple industries by lowering entry barriers. 
•  Speed is crucial in the digital economy, and agility and innovation are prioritised over 

perfection. 

•  Businesses should focus on customer needs and reimagine their strategies accordingly. 
•  Embracing scale, scope, and speed simultaneously can lead to a stronger competitive 

position in the digital economy. 

Video 9: The Rise of Ecosystems  

•  To adapt to the new digital reality, businesses need to reimagine themselves around their 

customers. 

•  Businesses need to focus on the customer value proposition: who they serve, how they serve 

them, and what makes them unique. 

•  Businesses need to differentiate between delivered needs and latent needs. 
•  Disruption occurs when a company identifies and serves latent needs that incumbents have 

overlooked or found unprofitable. 

•  Examples of disruptive companies include Netflix, Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb. 
•  The new rules of the game in the digital economy create both threats and opportunities for 

disruption.

•  Consumers' preferences are changing, with a shift towards sharing rather than owning, as 

seen in industries like music and transportation. 

•  Generational shifts, particularly with digital natives (born after 1997), bring new expectations 

• 

and behaviours, both as customers and employees. 
It is crucial for firms to recognise blind spots and identify latent needs to stay competitive in 
the digital economy. 

Video 10: New Ecosystems  

•  Ecosystems are important for digital strategy because they allow organisations to collaborate 

with other players to create new value propositions. 

•  There are three key players in today's industries: incumbents, digital giants, and digital 

entrepreneurs. 

•  Digital giants have disruptive capabilities due to their financial resources and access to top 

talent. 

•  Startups initiated by individuals from digital giants or incumbents can offer innovative 

solutions for latent customer needs. 

•  Strategic partnerships with digital giants and tech entrepreneurs are essential for launching 

experiments and innovations. 

•  By embracing the concept of ecosystems and strategically partnering with relevant players, 
organisations can navigate the digital landscape and capitalize on latent needs, driving 
innovation and growth.
