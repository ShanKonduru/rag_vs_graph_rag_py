Week 2: CTO as Strategy Catalyst 

One  of  the  crucial  roles  of  the  Chief  Technology  Officer  (CTO)  is  that  of  a  strategy 
catalyst. But what exactly does this mean? What specific skills and knowledge does a 
CTO need to possess? And how can they contribute to an organisation as a strategy 
catalyst?  In  this  discussion,  we  will  explore  these  questions  and  provide  relevant 
examples to contextualise this role. 

Digital Transformation: Examples 

To better understand the role of a strategy catalyst, let's consider a couple of examples. 
Best Buy, a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer specialising in electronic equipment for 
the  home,  faced  an  existential  threat  from  the  rise  of  internet-based  businesses  like 
Amazon.  Realising  the  need  for  transformation,  Best  Buy  embarked  on  a  journey  to 
become  a  modern  digital  retailer.  Through  their  Renew  Blue  strategy,  Best  Buy 
successfully  transitioned  from  a  traditional  brick-and-mortar  retailer  to  a  digital 
omnichannel retailer. 

Another example is Asian Paints, a longstanding paint manufacturer that primarily relied 
on  B2B  distribution  channels.  However,  Asian  Paints  underwent  a  digital 
transformation, positioning themselves as a data science company that not only sells 
paints  but  also  assists  customers  in  finding  décor  solutions  for  their  homes  and 
apartments. By repositioning themselves in this way, Asian Paints gained market share 
and became a modern company appealing to the millennials and the digital generation. 

These  examples  highlight  how  companies  recognised  the  threats  and  opportunities 
presented  by  digital  transformation,  digital  strategy,  and  innovation.  The  success  of 
such endeavours is often closely tied to the role of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). 
In  this  context,  we  will  delve  into  understanding  the  role  of  the  CTO  as  a  strategy 
catalyst. 

Key Considerations for Aspiring CTOs 

If you aspire to become a CTO and serve as an effective strategy catalyst, it is essential 
to acquire specific knowledge and skills. Topics to be explored include understanding 
the  digital  economy,  recognising  the  challenges  and  opportunities  it  presents  for 
disruption and innovation, and comprehending the dynamics of new partnerships within 
the emerging digital ecosystems. Additionally, grasping competitive moves for success 
is vital to drive digital strategy and innovation forward. 

Digital Economy 

There  exist  numerous  ways  to  define  the  digital  economy,  yet  at  its  core  lies  the 
increasing prominence of a wide range of technologies. These  technologies, such as 
the  cloud,  facilitate  seamless  information  transfer  between  different  locations  and 
devices, enabling a state of constant connectivity.

Role of Cloud 

The cloud serves not only as a connectivity tool but also as a vital  resource for data 
storage. In an era characterised by vast amounts of data, often referred to as big data, 
there is a pressing need to store this data efficiently. The cloud provides a solution to 
this data storage challenge, enabling the handling of massive volumes of information 
with ease. 

Impact of Social Media Technologies 

In  today's  world,  social  networking  and  collaboration  play  significant  roles.  The 
increasing  prominence  of  social  media  technologies  has  created  a  plethora  of 
opportunities  for  social  commerce,  an  integral  component  of  the  digital  economy. 
Additionally,  platforms  have  emerged  to  facilitate  content  creation,  commercial 
transactions, and connections among individuals. This evolution has given rise to new 
forms of collaboration between companies, all aimed at meeting the diverse needs of 
customers. 

The Foundation Technologies (SMAC + IoT) 

At  the  heart  of  the  digital  economy  lie  a  group  of  foundational  technologies.  These 
include  

•  Social  technologies  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter,  which  foster  social 

connections.  

•  Mobile  technologies,  such  as  smartphones  and  tablets,  that  have  further 

facilitated the digital transformation 

•  Analytics software and engines, the rise of which has enabled organisations 

to extract insights from vast amounts of data 

•  Cloud  services  like  Amazon's  AWS,  Azure,  and  Google  solutions  that  have 
experienced widespread adoption, leading to the migration of infrastructure from 
company premises to the cloud.  

The integration of these technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) completes the 
framework. Collectively, they form the foundation of the digital economy, often referred 
to by the acronym SMAC plus IoT. 

The  digital  economy  is  a  dynamic  landscape  that  constantly  evolves.  Notably,  the 
growing  enthusiasm  surrounding  wearables  exemplifies  the  ongoing  innovations  in 
mobility. As technology continues to advance, the social, mobile, analytics, cloud, and 
IoT  framework  remains  fundamental  in  understanding  the  digital  economy  and  its 
potential. 

Drivers of Digital Economy  

Moore's Law: Computing Capacity Doubling 

Over  30  years  ago,  Gordon  Moore  predicted  that  computing  capacity  would  double 
every  18  months.  This  prediction  has  held  true,  leading  to  exponential  growth  in 
computing  power.  The  transformation  is  evident  when  comparing  the  room-filling 

 ISB CTO

mainframe computers of the past with today's smartphones and smartwatches, which 
possess  far greater computing  capacity.  This  exponential growth has  made massive 
computing power accessible to users, enabling access to vast amounts of information. 

Metcalfe's Law: Exponential Growth in Connections 

Metcalfe's  law explains  the exponential growth  in  connections and  the  value  derived 
from networks. With two telephones, there is only one connection possible. However, 
as  the  number  of  telephone  owners  increases,  the  number  of  possible  connections 
grows exponentially. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter exemplify 
this phenomenon, allowing millions of users to connect and engage in social commerce. 
Metcalfe's Law  showcases the  rise of  social  connections and  the explosion  of  social 
media. 

Bandwidth Law: Liberating Data Transmission 

The bandwidth law highlights the evolution of data transmission capabilities. In the past, 
data could only be transmitted through narrow band networks, resulting in slow transfer 
rates. Today, with 5G networks and increased bandwidth, multimedia content, including 
images and videos, can be seamlessly transmitted to smartphones. This transformation 
has revolutionised various aspects of daily life, including shopping, where individuals 
can browse product images and make purchases without visiting physical stores. 

Waves in Digital Economy  

Within the dynamic landscape of the digital economy, we have witnessed a continuous 
stream  of  technological  innovations.  To  make  sense  of  this  phenomenon,  we  can 
categorise innovation into waves, each characterised by distinct sets of technologies. 

First Wave 

The first wave comprises of foundational technologies, mobile technologies, analytics 
and cloud.  

Foundational technologies 

These are an integral part of the first wave. Among these social technologies such as 
Facebook and Twitter have 

•  Revolutionised social media engagement 
•  Connected  customer  communities,  where  word-of-mouth  holds  as  much 

influence as traditional advertising 

Companies  can  now  leverage  this  social  connectivity  to  foster  collaboration  among 
designers worldwide, leading to a new approach to R&D and innovation. Additionally, 
businesses are recognising the potential for crowdsourcing, tapping into the innovative 
capabilities of their customers. 

Mobile Technologies 

The emergence of these technologies is another crucial pillar of the first wave. This has 
opened up new business innovation opportunities, such as

•  Micro-moments which involve creating impulsive purchases through geotagging, 

geo-sensing and geolocation 

•  Hybrid  work  and  virtual  collaboration  that  impact  talent  management  and  the 

treatment of employees 

•  Creation of seamless omnichannel experiences for customers 
• 
Integration of in-store, online and app-based interactions  
•  Advent of augmented reality that has transformed customer experiences 

Analytics 

Analytics empower businesses to gain deeper insights into their customers, employees 
and suppliers. This newfound intelligence derived from data has led to the rise of search 
engine optimisation and innovative marketing and advertising strategies. 

Cloud 

The Cloud has enhanced business agility, enabling companies to follow their customers 
rather  than  expecting  customers  to  follow  them.  For  instance,  imagine  seamlessly 
transitioning from watching a movie on an app on your TV to continuing it on your mobile 
phone while outdoors. The power of the cloud makes this seamless transition possible, 
opening up new avenues for product innovation and customer relationships. 

Second Wave  

While  the  first  wave  of  digital  technologies,  including  social,  mobile,  analytics,  and 
cloud, were undoubtedly significant and influential, they primarily focused on connecting 
people to people. For instance, mobile phones facilitated communication between their 
owners, and social technologies enabled interactions among individuals. However, a 
substantial sector of the economy, known as the physical economy, remained outside 
the realm of these technologies. This sector encompassed physical artifacts such as 
cars,  homes,  refrigerators,  washing  machines  and  even  billboards  displaying 
advertisements. 

To  achieve  a  comprehensive  digital  economy,  it  was  essential  to  bridge  the  gap 
between the digital and physical realms. This is where the second wave of technology 
made a significant difference.  

The  second  wave  introduced  the  concept  of  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT).  While  the 
precursor to IoT was the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) sensor, its capabilities 
were  limited.  The  advent  of  IoT  transformed  physical  devices  into  smart  devices, 
enabling their connection and integration into the digital ecosystem. 

The  second  wave  extended  the  connectivity  beyond  people-to-people  interactions 
observed in the first wave.  

• 

It  enabled  people-to-object  connections,  linking  homes,  cars,  refrigerators, 
and other physical artifacts to individuals.  

•  Object-to-object  connections  became  possible,  allowing  devices 

like 
refrigerators  and  washing  machines  to  communicate  with  each  other  or  with 
external systems such as utility companies.

This  convergence  opened  up  a  wide  range  of  possibilities  for  innovative  products, 
services, and experiences such as: 

•  Wearables: These devices, equipped with smart sensors facilitate connections 
between individuals and their devices. The second wave essentially merged the 
physical  and  digital  worlds,  enabling  seamless  integration  and  transformative 
opportunities.

The New Digital Reality  

This can be described as what is out there in terms of technology trends and uses that 
influence  digital  innovation,  which  in  turn  influence  the  need  for  rethinking  business 
strategy. Some of the new elements of the digital reality can be summarised as follows:  

Big data analytics and artificial intelligence 

•  Marketing  managers  employ  behavioural  segmentation  and  gain  insights  into 

sentiment and purchase behaviour.  

•  This  enables  smarter  decision  making  and  personalised  recommendations, 

revolutionising market segmentation. 

Social web 

• 

Introduces new forms of customer-firm interactions and influences attitudes and 
consumption behaviours.  

•  Firms can leverage social media intelligence to capture consumer-to-business 

(C2B) messaging.  

•  Consumers  express  their  sentiments  on  social  media,  allowing  companies  to 

gauge brand perception and customer experiences.  

•  Consumer-to-consumer  (C2C)  interactions  on  platforms  like  Facebook  and 

Twitter  

o  Contribute to a deeper understanding of customer sentiment  
o  Play  a  significant  role 

in  marketing  and  customer  relationship

Internet of Things (IoT) 

•  Connects  products 

through  sensors  and  software,  enabling  advanced 
functionalities.  For  instance,  cars  equipped  with  telematic  services  can  track 
maintenance  needs  and  automatically  schedule  servicing,  streamlining  the 
customer experience.  
IoT-driven  services  make  customers'  lives  easier  and  contribute  to  a  more 
efficient and convenient product usage. 

• 

Robotics, drones, and 3D technologies 

•  Are shaping the supply chain landscape 
•  Offer quick and efficient order fulfilment 
•  Disrupt traditional trucking and logistics industries

•  Enhance customer interactions and product discovery.  

Examples: Customers can virtually tour homes, try on clothing, visualise furniture 
in their own space, and experience virtual test drives.  

•  Offer endless possibilities for immersive and engaging customer experiences,  
•  Transform the way customers engage with products and services. 

Competing in the Digital Economy 

There are three dimensions or rules for competing in the digital economy. Today firms 
must position themselves to compete along scale, along scope, and along speed.  

Let's look at each of these concepts with examples 

Scale 

•  Refers to market share or customer penetration.  
•  Examples:  

o  Google's dominance in online searches, with 80% market share in online 

advertising 

o  Uber's exponential growth to 3.9 million drivers and delivering 7.6 billion 

rides annually  

o  Airbnb's  ability  generate  is  more  than  four  times  the  number  of  room 

bookings made by the rest of the hotel industry 

 ISB CTO 

6  

 
   
  
  
 
 
•  Provides valuable customer insight, making it crucial for companies to aim for 

dominance in their respective markets. 

Scope 

•  Refers to the number of industries a firm competes in 
•  Examples: Digital giants like Apple, Google, and Amazon have expanded their 

reach into multiple industries 

•  Enables some companies to become cross-boundary disruptors 

Speed 

•  Measured by time to market and the ability to adapt quickly 
•  Trumps perfection, as customer needs evolve rapidly 
•  Focus on quick product launch and leveraging customer feedback to continually 

innovate and refine.  

•  Can be achieved by strategies such as  

o  Open innovation  
o  Customer involvement in the design process 
o  Strategic A/B experimentation 
o  Experiments with different versions 

The  digital economy  has  rewritten  the  rules  of  competition,  necessitating  a  focus  on 
scale, scope, and speed. Companies must aim for dominance in their markets, compete 
across industries and embrace agility and innovation. By understanding and adapting 
to these new rules, businesses can navigate the dynamic digital landscape and remain 
competitive in the ever-evolving digital economy. 

Defining Business Strategy 

In light of our understanding of the digital reality and the new rules of  competition, it 
becomes essential to redefine business strategy. It is worth contemplating the nature 
of business strategy and its components. Commonly, business strategy encompasses 
considerations  such  as  customer  focus,  differentiation,  mission,  vision,  values,  and 
resource management. While these aspects hold merit individually, let us now redefine 
business strategy by focusing on two concrete ideas: 

 ISB CTO 

7  

 
   
  
  
 
 
•  Business strategy should centre around achieving scale, scope, and speed. This 
entails a deliberate effort to expand operations, broaden the range of offerings, 
and maintain agility in responding to market demands. 

•  There is a need to envision or reimagine business strategies based on customer 
needs rather than being solely product- or service-centric. By shifting the focus 
towards  understanding  and  fulfilling  customer  requirements,  businesses  can 
foster stronger connections and drive long-term success. 

Illustration: John Deere's Transformation 

To illustrate the redefined business strategy, let us consider the example of John Deere, 
a company with nearly a century of experience in manufacturing agricultural equipment. 
Operating across multiple countries, their equipment can be found on numerous farms. 

Historically, John Deere was synonymous with farming. However, as global competition 
emerged,  primarily  from  Asia  with  lower  cost  structures,  John  Deere  encountered 
challenges  in  sustaining  its  competitive  position,  given  the  limitations  of  price-based 
competition.  In  response,  John  Deere  underwent  a  process  of  self-reflection.  They 
realised  that  their  previous  perspective  positioned  them  as  sellers  of  agricultural 
equipment. Their strategic definition revolved around being "in the business of making 
and selling agricultural equipment." 

However, a pivotal insight emerged during this contemplation. John Deere recognised 
that they held a wealth of knowledge about the farmers they served, enabling them to 
establish a position of trust. They possessed valuable information regarding farmers' 
land holdings, weather conditions, and soil characteristics.  

With this realisation, John Deere decided to redefine their business beyond the mere 
sale  of  tractors. Their new vision  involved  becoming the  trusted advisors to farmers, 
shifting their focus towards comprehensive farm management and consider the holistic 
needs of farmers.  

They identified three elements in farm management to focus their strategy on, weather, 
seeds and irrigation. 

Weather 

They acknowledged that weather played a critical role in farm productivity and yield. 
Unfavourable  weather  conditions  such  as  excessive  heat  or  rain  could  lead  to  crop 
losses. Understanding this vulnerability, John Deere  

•  Recognised  the  significance  of  weather  data  and  its  implications  for  effective 

farm management.  

•  Explored opportunities to provide farmers with  

Intelligence on weather patterns, weather maps, forecasts 

o 
o  Sensors for rainfall, humidity, and temperature.  

These  were  services  they  had  not  previously  considered,  but  which  held 
tremendous potential.

Seeds 

John Deere identified another crucial element in farm management: seed optimisation. 
The  effectiveness  of  seeds  relies  on  various  soil  conditions,  including  acidity  and 
dryness. To assist farmers in this regard, John Deere aimed to 

•  Offer information through seed databases and farm performance data.  
•  Enable  farmers  to  customise  seed  selection  and  treatment  to  optimise 

performance on their specific plots of land.  

This domain  traditionally  fell  within  the  realm  of  agricultural scientists,  a  field  distinct 
from John Deere's expertise. 

Irrigation 

Proper irrigation plays a vital role in farm productivity. Balancing the need to conserve 
water while providing the right amount at the right time posed challenges. John Deere 
recognised  the  importance  of  irrigation  optimisation.  They  began  integrating  field 
sensors,  irrigation  nodes,  and  irrigation  applications  to  enhance  water  management 
strategies. 

Reimagining the Business 

Through  this  transformative  process,  John  Deere  realised  that  manufacturing 
agricultural equipment represented only one aspect of their offerings. While it served 
as an initial point of entry into the farmer's world, it presented an opportunity to redefine 
their business around farm management. By expanding their services to include holistic 
advice on weather, seed optimisation, and irrigation, in addition to providing equipment, 
John Deere positioned themselves as invaluable partners to farmers. 

John  Deere's  historical  advantage  in  scale,  having  served  the  largest  number  of 
farmers, afforded them a wealth of intelligence and insight. This knowledge surpassed 
that  of  their  competitors.  By  redefining  their  business  strategy  to  focus  on  farm 
management,  John  Deere  effectively  sidestepped  concerns  regarding  price-based 
competition. This example exemplifies the new rule in today's business landscape. 

The example of John Deere prompts us to reflect on our own companies. It is vital to 
consider  the  products  we  sell  and  services  we  provide.  Are  they  the  sole  basis  for 
defining  competition?  Understanding  our  customers  and  their  specific  needs  is  key. 
Exploring  complementary  consumption,  or  the  additional  products  and  services 
consumed  alongside  ours,  can  unveil  opportunities  for  growth.  By  identifying  and 
addressing customer pain points, we can strive to become trusted advisors, reimagining 
our businesses based on their needs rather than our products. 

The Rise of Ecosystems  

Having explored the transformative aspects of the new digital reality, the evolving rules 
of competition, and the imperative to reimagine competitive strategy, let us delve deeper 
into  the  practical  application  of  these  concepts.  Is  there  a  framework  that  can  guide 

 ISB CTO 

9  

 
   
  
  
companies in adapting to the new world order shaped by the digital reality? Are there 
specific questions that serve as catalysts for strategic thinking?  

One fundamental question to ponder is the essence of your customer value proposition. 
A value proposition entails understanding  

•  Who your customers are 
•  How you serve them 
•  What unique qualities foster loyalty. 

Building upon the customer value proposition, it is crucial to consider two categories of 
customer needs:  

•  Delivered needs  

o  Customer needs that incumbents in an industry operate around  
o  Example: Banks tailor their services to customers with established credit 
histories and steady incomes. They generally meet the standard needs of 
customers, such as banking and checking accounts, access to ATMs and 
physical branch offices.  

•  Latent needs 

o  Customer  needs  that  incumbents  consider  non-profitable  and  do  not 

serve 

o  Example: Banks generally do not cater to people with no steady income 

but need to do financial transactions 

Disruption through identifying latent needs 

To illustrate the impact of identifying latent needs, let us examine the disruption caused 
by Netflix in the video streaming industry which was dominated by Blockbuster with its 
convenient brick-and-mortar stores.  

Blockbuster 
•  Had stores that customers could walk 

Netflix 
•  Delivered  movies 

to  customers 

into and pick their movie 

through mail 

•  Allowed customers to rent the movies 

•  Delivered  the  top  three  movies  from

Imposed  penalties  for  late  returns  of 
the  rented  moved  to  keep  inventory

•  Did  not  have  any 

fees  so 
customers could watch movies at their 
own pace 
Introduced  the  subscription  model 
with a fixed fee 

•  Consumer dissatisfaction due to latent needs being ignored especially when they 
find their traditional experience to be stressful, intimidating, complicated and low 
trust 

 ISB CTO 

10  

 
   
  
  
 
•  Despite  significant  changes  in  consumer  preferences,  incumbents  focus  on 
delivering known needs leads to blind spots, leaving latent needs unaddressed.  
•  Altered consumption patterns and values due to the emergence of digital natives, 
the  millennial  generation  who  prioritise  environmental 
represented  by 
sustainability, purpose-driven business practices and innovative approaches to 
problem-solving.  

To become a strategy catalyst in the digital economy, organisations must embrace the 
new digital reality, redefine their customer value proposition and uncover latent needs. 
By recognising the limitations of delivered needs and leveraging disruptive innovations, 
companies can stay ahead of the competition. 

New Ecosystems  

In  the  realm  of  digital  strategy,  it  is  crucial  to  consider  the  evolving  landscape  of 
disruption, latent needs, and delivered needs. In addition to these aspects, one must 
also recognise the significance of ecosystems as a strategy catalyst.  

Every industry comprises three distinct groups of players: 

• 

Incumbents  

o  Traditional leaders who focus on fulfilling delivered needs  
o  Example: Maruti in the automobile industry, Hilton and Hyatt in the hotel 

industry 

o  May have blind spots regarding latent needs 

•  Digital giants  

o  Limited set of tech companies  
o  Example: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Uber, Microsoft.  
o  Possess  exceptional  capabilities  in  achieving  scale,  scope,  and  speed, 
primarily  due  to  their  substantial  financial  resources  and  access  to  top 
talent 

o  Have the capacity to invest in experiments, embrace disruption, and take 

risks, thereby enabling them to address latent needs effectively 

•  Digital entrepreneurs  

o  Start-ups  initiated  by  individuals  working  for  either  digital  giants  or 

incumbents 

o  Possess an understanding of latent customer needs and the imagination 

to develop innovative digital solutions to address them 

Within  every industry today,  these  three groups  coexist,  each  playing  a  distinct  role. 
Incumbents  continue  to  hold  their  position  as  industry  leaders,  while  digital  giants 
disrupt the status quo through their substantial resources and talent. Simultaneously, 
digital  entrepreneurs,  driven  by  their  understanding  of  latent  needs  and  innovative 
ideas, emerge as influential players. 

The Rise of Ecosystems 

 ISB CTO 

11  

 
   
  
  
 
 
Contrary  to  the  initial  expectation  that  digital  giants  would  displace  incumbents,  a 
different  pattern  has  emerged.  Rather  than  complete  displacement,  we  witness  the 
emergence  of  new  ecosystems.  For  example,  in  the  automobile  industry,  despite 
Google's  and  Tesla's  early  experimentation  with  autonomous  and  electric  vehicles, 
respectively, the traditional automakers like Ford, GM, BMW, Audi, and Maruti have not 
been rendered obsolete. Instead, they have adapted by forging strategic partnerships. 

Ecosystems have become the new rule of competition. In the automotive sector, this is 
evident as companies form alliances to offer enhanced services. For instance, Tesla's 
partnership  with  Ford,  enabling  access  to  its  charging  stations  for  Ford  electric  car 
owners, exemplifies the rise of ecosystems.  

Identifying  and  collaborating  with  digital  giants  and  tech  entrepreneurs  is  crucial  for 
launching experiments and innovations centred around latent needs, thus shaping the 
new landscape of strategy. 

Competitive Moves for Success 

Today, being a strategy catalyst entails the ability to educate, comprehend, and apply 
the rules governing new competitive moves for achieving success. Let us now delve 
into these essential rules: 

•  Forming new ecosystems by identifying suitable partners 

This  entails  recognising  the  potential  collaborators  who  can  contribute  to  the 
growth  and  innovation  of  your  organisation.  Collaborative  partnerships  enable 
the  sharing  of  knowledge,  resources,  and  expertise,  ultimately  leading  to  a 
competitive advantage. 

•  Reimagining the business model around the customer 

By  amplifying  the  voice  of  the  customer,  you  gain  valuable  insights  into  their 
latent needs. Understanding and addressing these unmet needs pave the way 
for innovation and differentiation in the market. Customer-centricity should be at 
the core of your strategic decision-making processes. 

•  Leveraging the ecosystem for strategic experiments 

This approach enables the exploration of latent needs within your target market. 
By embracing experimentation and continuously learning, you can identify new 
business  opportunities  that  align  with  these  latent  needs.  Such  experiments 
foster agility, adaptability, and the ability to stay ahead of the competition.\ 

•  Leveraging the ecosystem to acquire new capabilities 

Collaborating with partners who possess complementary skills and expertise can 
bolster your organisation's ability to innovate and address emerging challenges. 
This  approach  promotes  growth 
through  knowledge  exchange,  skill 
augmentation, and the cultivation of a dynamic network of talents. 

To  illustrate  the  importance  of  these  rules,  consider  the  example  of  Ford.  Ford  has 
leveraged  its  ecosystem  to  learn  how  to  build  smart  cars,  adapting  to  the  changing 

 ISB CTO 

12  

 
   
  
  
 
 
 
landscape of the automotive industry. Additionally, Ford has formed a partnership with 
Uber to gain insights into the behaviour of ride-sharing users. By expanding their focus 
beyond  traditional  car  owners,  Ford  demonstrates  an  understanding  of  the  evolving 
market dynamics and the importance of catering to various customer segments. 

By  embracing  these  strategies  and  leveraging  ecosystems  effectively,  CTOs  can 
position themselves as catalysts for driving strategic success, fostering innovation, and 
ensuring long-term organisational growth.
