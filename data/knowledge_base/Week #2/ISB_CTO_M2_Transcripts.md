Week 2: CTO as Strategy Catalyst 

Video 1: Module Overview  

An important role of the CTO is that as a strategy catalyst. So, what does that mean? 
What type of specific skills does a CTO need to have? What knowledge does the CTO 
need to have? How can he or she help an organisation as a strategy catalyst? Why do 
we need such a role? These are some of the questions we will explore.   

Let's  think  about  a  couple  of  examples  to  place  this  role  in  a  context.  Best  Buy  is  a 
traditional  brick  and  mortar  retailer.  They  are  in  the  business  of  selling  electronic 
equipment for the home. A  legacy company which predates the internet, with the arrival 
of the dot-com businesses, they realised that they were at extinction level threat. There 
were stories about how Best Buy would be disintermediated, made obsolete by the rise 
of Amazon and other internet retailers. So, the challenge for Best Buy was how do we 
transform ourselves from a brick and mortar retailer to be a modern digital retailer? The 
story of Best Buy today is their growth and renewal as part of their renew blue strategy, 
where Best Buy has gone from being a traditional brick and mortar retailer, to being a 
digital omnichannel retailer.  

Another example, Asian Paints. Asian Paints is a paint manufacturer, long legacy. They 
are  a  traditional  paint  company  that  sold  paints  through  a  B2B  distribution  channel. 
Today, Asian Paints is a story of digital transformation, revival and transformation into 
a data science company that sells paints, who has transformed themselves from selling 
paints to helping customers find decor solutions for their homes and apartments. And 
doing so, they have gained market share, they have repositioned themselves and made 
themselves  to  be  a  modern  company  that  appeals  to  the  millennials  and  the  digital 
generation.  

There are many such examples of how companies have recognised the threat and the 
opportunity of digital transformation, of the emergence of digital strategy and innovation, 
and how they have transformed themselves. Central to their success in digital strategy 
and  innovation  is  the  role  of  a  Chief  Technology  Officer.  So,  we  will  look  at  and 
understand the role of a Chief Technology Officer as a strategy catalyst. For you as an 
aspiring Chief Technology Officer, what do you need know to be an effective strategy 
catalyst?   

Topics  we  will  include  are:  What  is  the  digital  economy?  What  challenges  and 
opportunities  does  it  present  for  disruption  and  innovation?  What  are  the  new 
partnerships, what we call the new digital ecosystems?  And what are the competitive 
moves for success?

Video 2: Digital Economy 

Let  us  begin  by  first  talking  about  the  digital  economy.  What  is  the  digital  economy, 
because it's a word we have been using frequently. There are many ways of defining 
the digital economy, but fundamental to all these definitions is the rising prominence of 
a whole suite and a wave of technologies. There are technologies such as the cloud 
which provide connectivity for transferring information seamlessly from place to place, 
device  to  device,  so  we  call  it  being  connected.  Then  of  course,  the  cloud  is  also  a 
resource for storage of data. In an economy and in a world of big data where the data 
that  we  use  is  characterised  by  volume,  velocity,  variety,  there's  a  need  for  storing 
massive amounts of data, and the cloud is a solution to this data storage problem. We 
also live in a world of social networking and collaboration, so the prominence of social 
media technologies has given rise to a whole set of opportunities for social commerce, 
another element of the digital economy. And then of course, we are seeing the rise of 
platforms for content, for commerce and connection. In other words, we're finding new 
forms of collaboration between companies to serve the needs of the customers.  

Fundamental  to  all  of  these  are  a  group  of  technologies  which  we  will  call  social 
technologies, such as Facebook, Twitter and other forms of social connection. Mobility 
technologies,  with  the  rise  of  the  smartphones  and  the  tablets.  Analytics,  the  rise  of 
analytics  software  and  engines,  and  data.  Cloud,  we  see  increasing  proliferation  of 
Amazon's AWS, the Azure solution, Google solutions. And we are seeing the migration 
of platforms from inside the company, the infrastructure from inside the company to the 
cloud and then marry that with the Internet of Things.  

So, think about the acronym SMAC; social, mobile, analytics cloud plus IoT, SMAC plus 
IoT. These are the technologies which are the foundation of the digital economy. And 
we  continually  see  evolution;  think  about  the  growing  excitement  around  wearables. 
Wearables  are  an  example  of  mobility,  so  we  continue  to  see  more  and  more 
technology innovations. But fundamentally, this framework of social, mobile, analytics, 
cloud, plus IoT is a way to think about the digital economy.  

Video 3: Drivers of Digital Economy 

What are the fundamental drivers of the digital economy? Why are we seeing relentless 
wave of technology innovation?  

There are three explanations for this, and they are based upon historical observations, 
and in the form of three laws. One is called the Moore's law, the second one is called 
the Metcalfe's law and the third one is called the Bandwidth law. Let's understand them 
to recognise why we arrived at this moment in time with phenomenal opportunities for 
digital innovation.  

Gordon Moore predicted more than 30 years ago that computing capacity would double 
every 18 months, and we have gone through at least 10 or more waves or cycles of 
such exponential doubling of computing capacity. Think about a mainframe computer 
that filled a room 20 years ago. These were the massive computers that led to NASA 
launching  missions  to  the  moon,  but  they  took  room  full  of  mainframe  computers. 

 ISB CTO

Today, the smartphone that you have with you or the smart watch that you wear on your 
wrist has far more computing capacity than that mainframe, which filled the room. But 
think about the scale of miniaturisation and the exponential growth of computing. So, 
we are bringing massive computing capacity to the users wherever they are and giving 
them access to phenomenal amounts of information. Marry that with the Metcalfe's law, 
which explains the exponential growth in connections, and we call it the law of networks.  

Let's understand that with a simple example. Suppose there were only two people who 
were able to buy a telephone in their homes. How many people could they talk to? The 
answer  is  one  because  it  takes  two  phones  to  connect  users.  So,  the  value  of  two 
phones is one, one's connection. Now let's think about five owners of telephones. How 
many  connections  are  possible?  And  the  answer  is  5C2,  it's  called  the  law  of 
combination. 5C2 is 5 * 4 / 2 = 10. So, people who have five telephones, they can have 
10 possible connections. So, if you graph this, two phones; one connection, five phones; 
10 connections, you can do the same math with 10 phones. 10 phones lead to 10 * 9, 
90 /  2  = 45  connections.  That  explains  the  rise  of  social  media  and  the explosion  of 
social media, social connections, social commerce and all those things.  

The phenomenon of Facebook, Twitter and having thousands and millions of followers, 
where in the past we could maybe have conversations with 5-10 people who lived on 
the block. The third foundation is the Bandwidth law. Think about 20 years ago, the only 
way we could transmit data was through a modem with a narrow band network. It would 
take a large amount of time even to transfer modest amounts of data.  

Today, we have 5G networks. Let alone data, we can actually shoot images. We can 
send video content onto people's smartphones. People can watch their favourite sport 
game, they can watch their movie, or they can watch the YouTube videos while they 
are  sitting  in  a  car  or  while  they  are  riding  a  train  or  in  the  plane.  In  other  words, 
bandwidth has liberated us and given us the opportunity to send multimedia content. 
So, think about shopping. Now, on your smartphone, you can look at product pictures, 
you  can  look  at  product  images,  and  you  can  buy  products  without  ever  visiting  the 
store.  

So, these elements have given rise to the social, the mobile, the analytics, the cloud 
and  the  Internet  of  Things,  and  we  call  the  Moore's  law,  the  Metcalfe's  law  and  the 
Bandwidth law as the drivers of the digital transformation. These laws don't stop. If you 
have been following the more recent explosion in AI, and think about companies like 
Nvidia, which have become the new platforms for AI computing. It's an extension of the 
laws and it tells us that these forces will continue to grow and give us greater computing 
power, greater connections and greater storage capacity. So, imagine the implication 
that the digital revolution hasn't stopped. It is still going on and it's going to present us 
with more and more opportunities.  

Video 4: Digital Economy: First Wave 

In  the  digital  economy,  we  have  seen  relentless  technology  innovation.  How  do  we 
make sense of this? We can say that, that innovation has occurred in waves.  

 ISB CTO 

3  

 
   
  
  
The  first  wave  is  a  group  of  technologies  which  we  call  today  the  foundational 
technologies. What are they? They are the social technologies such as Facebook and 
Twitter. They have given us capabilities for social media engagement. They have given 
rise  to  the  connected  customer  or  the  customer  communities.  The  implication  of 
customer  communities  is  that  word  of  mouth  is  as  powerful  as  advertising  and 
influencing customers decisions about what to buy and who to buy it from. Similarly, 
social has given rise to increased collaboration. Companies can now build planes and 
cars by having designers located all around the world and being able to collaborate with 
each  other  in  real  time.  So,  it  creates  a  whole  new  way  of  thinking  about  R&D  and 
innovation. It also creates crowdsourcing. Companies are beginning to realise that the 
customers are a source of innovation, and that gives rise to crowdsourcing. Again, a 
social phenomenon.  

A second important pillar of the first wave is the rise of mobile technologies. What this 
has done is created some business innovation opportunities. For example, we now say 
that there are opportunities to create micro moments. What's a micro moment? You are 
going past a Starbucks and Starbucks now recognises it's you. They can send you an 
offer saying your brand of caramel macchiato is being freshly brewed right now. Come 
on in, place an order and take 20% off. That's a micro moment, creating an impulsive 
purchase,  giving  rise  to  what  we  call  geo-tagging,  geo-sensing,  and  geo-location, 
identifying  the  customers  in  the  vicinity  of  your  store  and  creating  micro  moment 
purchases or impulse purchases. We can also create collaboration on the move. We 
have liberated people from the physical confines of their offices. The COVID introduced 
the  idea  that  work  can  be  done  anywhere.  It  has  given  people  the  opportunities  for 
hybrid work, virtual work, and a lot of it has also been made possible through significant 
advances in mobile technologies. So, implications for how do you manage your talent 
and  how  do  you  treat  your  talent?  Mobile  has  also  given  rise  to  omnichannel 
experience, and an opportunity to give your customer an integrated experience in your 
store, on the Internet, and through an app on the phone. That creates new opportunities. 
And  more  recently,  mobile  has  given  rise  to  augmented  reality.  If  you  are  a  car 
company, you can now let your customer test drive your car virtually through augmented 
reality on their phone. Think about the possibilities for customer experience.  

A third element is analytics. You are becoming smarter about your customers, about 
your employees, about your suppliers, because you can unlock the secrets in the data. 
We  are  seeing  the  rise  of  search  engine  optimisation  and  other  ways  of  thinking, 
marketing and advertising. And the final element of the first wave is the cloud. Cloud is 
giving ability to be more agile. Rather than the customer following you, you can now 
follow your customer. Imagine you are watching your favourite Amazon Prime or Hulu 
movie  or  show.  And  at  some  point,  you  need  to  move  your  couch  to  maybe  going 
outdoors and you want to transfer that movie from the TV to your mobile phone. You 
can do that seamlessly today because of the power of the cloud. So, imagine what does 
it  mean  for  product  innovation  and  what  does  it  mean  for  new  forms  of  customer 
relationship. So, this is the first wave. This gave rise to Internet commerce or what we 
call  e-commerce.  And  the  first  wave  typically  was  somewhere  around  2000  through 
about 2015.

Video 5: Digital Economy: Second Wave 

While the first wave of digital technologies were very important and influential, one of 
their  limitations  was,  they  were  mostly  connecting  people  to  people.  For  example, 
people who had mobile phones, they were connecting to the owners of those mobile 
phones. Those same people were connected to each other through social technologies. 
Yet, there is a vast sector of the economy which was predating these technologies, and 
we call that the physical economy. Examples of which are people's cars, their homes, 
their refrigerators, their washing machines, if you walk outside all those billboards which 
have advertisements. So, much as advantageous social mobility, analytics and cloud 
were nearly 70% of the economy, which was in the form of these physical artifacts was 
being left out.  

So, for the digital revolution, for the digital economy to be complete, how do we bring 
those into the fold? That's where the second wave made a difference. The second wave 
is the Internet of Things. Fundamentally, the precursor to the Internet of Things were 
the RFID sensors. But the RFID sensors were very limited in their ability. The arrival of 
Internet of Things suddenly created a whole new area of activity where every physical 
device suddenly became a smart device. A refrigerator became a smart refrigerator, a 
home became a smart home, appliances became smart appliances. And as a result, 
suddenly we could bring them and connect them. And this opened up a whole range of 
possibilities about products, services and innovations.  

So,  the  second  wave,  the  Internet  of  everything  completed  the  revolution  that  was 
launched by the first  wave. Think of an example, the wearables. The wearables is an 
example of smart sensors in your clothes. And by the advancements in the wearables, 
suddenly  we  are  now  able  to  connect  your  clothing  to  your  refrigerator,  and  to  your 
mobile  devices.  Your  washing  machine  can  now  request  electricity  from  the  central 
server at a time when the rates are very low, because nobody else is using electricity. 
And  therefore,  run  the  washing  machine  while  you  are  sleeping,  but  also  procure 
electricity  at  the  cheapest  rates  and  help  improve  the  conservation  of  energy, 
environment and things like that.  

So, the second wave really can be described as connecting the physical and the digital 
worlds. Now, imagine with the second  wave, we can convert these static billboards into 
intelligent billboards. They can sense you, and they can know what kind of things you 
like to buy, and they can display the ads which are people-specific, so they become 
dynamic. So, these are some of the exciting elements which the second wave brought 
on top of the first wave. 

Video 6: The New Digital Reality 

Having understood  the  drivers  of  the  digital economy,  the first wave  and  the  second 
wave of digital technologies, we can now describe the new digital reality. What is out 
there  in  terms  of  technology  trends  and  uses  that  influence  digital  innovation,  that 
influence the need for rethinking business strategy.  

 ISB CTO 

5  

 
   
  
  
So, let's summarise some of the new elements of what we call the digital reality. Today, 
big data, analytics and artificial intelligence, they augment decision making, they help 
us make smarter decisions. So, if you are a marketing manager, you have enormous 
amounts  of  data  about  your  customers'  sentiments  expressed  on  social  media,  their 
purchase  behaviour.  And  traditionally,  where  you  have  to  rely  on  limited  data  to  do 
market segmentation. Today, you can do behavioural segmentation. You can actually 
understand  what  are  people's  sentiments,  what  are  they  buying,  and  be  able  to 
recommend to them, things that they will actually buy. So, smart decision making.  

Secondly,  the  social  web  creates  new  forms  of  interactions  between  customers  and 
their  firms  and  creates  new  ways  of  influencing  their  attitudes  and  consumption 
behaviours. What does this mean? Traditionally, there was only one medium for a firm 
to reach its customers and that was paid media or advertising. If the firms wanted to 
understand their customer sentiments, they had limited ways of doing that. The only 
way  they  could  do  that  was  through  market  research  or  common  cards.  In  market 
research,  you  are  lucky  if  you  get  30%  response  rate,  meaning  that  you  get  small 
number  of  responses.  In  common  cards,  what  research  has  shown  is  that those are 
biased. The majority of the people who fill common cards are unhappy about something. 
Some  of  them  are  happy,  but  there  are  very  few  people  in  the  middle  who  fill  out 
common  cards.  But  today,  in  addition  to  the  firm  directed  messaging,  which  we  call 
B2C, business to consumer, we also have the ability through social media to capture 
C2B, consumer to business messaging.  

So,  when  the  consumers  go  on  to  social  media  to  express  their  sentiment  about  a 
product  or  a  company,  we  have  a  new  area  of  development  called  social  media 
intelligence  where  you  can  gather  the  sentiment  and  learn  what  are  the  attitudes 
towards  your  brand  or  toward  an  experience  with  your  company.  So,  we  have  B2C 
complemented  with  C2B.  And  then  the  third  layer,  we  call  that  C2C,  consumer  to 
consumer. Consumers are more likely to talk to each other on their Facebook, Twitter 
and they talk to each other and reach thousands of others. So, mining that sentiment is 
again an important source of insight about how your brand is performing. So, the social 
web creates new forms of customer insight and influences new ways of marketing and 
customer relationship. Third, mobile apps and cloud computing are becoming the new 
platform to augment the delivery of services to consumers.  

Today,  think  of  any  company  that  can  do  business  without  an  app.  That's  the  new 
frontier.  Even  the  internet  has  become  sort  of  outdated  because  the  app  bundles 
personalised  information  about  the  customer  with  their  preferences  for products  and 
services, and with convenience of payment. So, with the arrival of smart and cloud and 
mobility, apps are the new medium, and that has significant implications for how do you 
redefine the customer interface.  

Think about Starbucks. The enrichment of the customer interface between Starbucks 
and its customers is a large measure due to their apps. Because their customers travel, 
they carry phones, they have an app, and it makes it very easy to order their unique 
flavour of coffee and get reward points. This is a trend which cuts across all companies 
today. Fourth, the Internet of Things links all products through sensors and software. 

 ISB CTO

So, the car today is a smart car, where you can build telematic services. You can track 
when your customer's car needs maintenance and automatically schedule maintenance 
or even pick up the car, finish the maintenance and deliver it. So, once again, making 
your customer's life easier because of the Internet of Things.  

There  are  more  recent  developments.  Robotics,  drones,  3D;  they  are  becoming  key 
drivers  and  enablers  of  supply  chain.  Companies  like  Amazon  are  increasingly 
experimenting with drone-based home delivery. What does that do? It means that you 
can order something and have it be delivered to your home within an hour. Think about 
what does that do to groceries? Think about what does that do to immediate fulfilment? 
But also think about, how does that disrupt the trucking and the logistics industries when 
retailers bypass them in reaching directly to their customers. And then the beat goes 
on.  

We have augmented reality, virtual reality and more new technologies that continually 
enrich  customer interactions and  ways  in  which  they  discover products  and  services 
with  augmented  reality,  virtual  driving,  discovering  what  car  you  like,  buying  homes. 
Augmented reality: you can actually virtually tour a home. Buying furniture: you can use 
virtual  reality  to  look  at  furniture  and  then  use  the  virtual  reality  feature  along  with 
augmented reality to picture how that furniture would look in the corner of your room 
before you buy it. Clothing: you can now use augmented reality to match your shirt and 
tie and jacket without physically trying them on.  

So,  think  about  the  possibilities  which  are  endless  and  that's  the  reason  why  Chief 
Technology Officers need to step up as strategy and innovation catalysts because they 
are the ones who are more knowledgeable about technology, and they must learn how 
to marry their knowledge of technology with the business strategy and innovation.  

Video 7: Competing in the Digital Economy 

What  does  this  new  digital  reality  do  to  competition?  Are  we  rewriting  the  rules  of 
competition? If so, what are those new rules?  

So,  let's think  about  three  dimensions  of  what  we  say  are  rules  for competing  in the 
digital economy. And they are: today firms must position themselves to compete along 
scale,  along  scope,  and  along  speed.  So,  let's  look  at  each  of  these  concepts  with 
examples and then we'll come back to say, what's the new rule of being competitive.  

So, what do we mean by scale? Scale can be loosely understood as market share or 
customer penetration. How much of the market do you own? Large scale means that 
you are the dominant player. Small scale means you are one among several players.  

Let's look at some examples of what is happening in a digital economy. Google, a digital 
player, in 1999, remember, Google is the dominant player in online searches. In 1999, 
Google  was  supporting  one  billion  searches.  Within  10  years,  Google  supports  1.2 
trillion searches. Think about the number of zeros. What that implies is that Google has 
achieved  dominant  scale  in  the  market  for  search  engine,  for  searching,  which 
translates into dominant market share for online advertising.  

 ISB CTO 

7  

 
   
  
  
Now,  what's  important  to  recognise  is  that  most  traditional  industries,  think  about 
automobile  industry.  What  do  you  think  is  the  maximum  market  share  a  single 
automotive  company  could  have?  If  you  said  30%,  you  would  say, yeah,  about that. 
35%? Yes, but not much more than that. How much market share does Google have in 
online advertising? 80%, that's what we mean by scale.  

Think about Uber. Uber had a few drivers in 2011. Today, Uber has 3.9 million drivers. 
Think about the scale. No taxi company has more than 100 to 1,000 drivers. Uber has 
3.9  million  drivers.  Another  way  of  thinking  about  Uber's  business,  what  do  taxi 
companies do? They provide rides. How do you measure their performance? Number 
of rides. Uber achieved within four to five years, by 2015, one billion rides in 2015. Six 
months later they hit the two billionth ride. And today, they deliver 7.6 billion rides each 
year, 20% growth year-on-year. It is simply unmatched by any other company.  

Airbnb. Airbnb is the lodging company. What's unique about Airbnb is that they don't 
own properties. But today, Airbnb every night, the number of room night bookings that 
they generate is more than four times the number of room bookings made by the rest 
of the hotel industry. Just think about what that means. Airbnb had 50,000 listings in 
2011.  By  2016  they  were  providing  two  million  listings,  and  today    six  million  plus 
listings. That's what we mean by scale. Why is this important?  

Scale gives you customer insight. Today, if you don't know your customers, if you don't 
know what they want, if you don't know their behaviours, you can't market to them. And 
each one of these companies that I have listed, it's not just the revenue that they are 
generating, it's the enormous scale of customer insight that they are gathering, which 
means that they become the dominant intermediaries. Others have to come to them 
and that's a unique position.  

So, the first rule of digital competition is aim for scale because it is feasible and if you 
don't do it, somebody else will. The second dimension is scope. What do we mean by 
scope?  How  many  industries  does  the  firm  compete  in?  Think  about  automobile 
companies.  How  many  industries  do  they  compete  in?  Typically,  the  answer  is  one, 
they sell cars. Think about healthcare, typically one or two industries.  

Now,  let's  ask  the  question,  how  many  industries  does  Apple  compete  in?  Apple 
originally  was  a  hardware  manufacturer.  So,  one  industry  hardware.  They  are  a 
software company. But today, Apple is a digital payments company. It is a music and 
entertainment company, it is an education company, it is a healthcare company, and it 
is a cloud services company. So, you can see that Apple we counted at least seven 
industries that they compete in.  

What about Google? Google started with online advertising. They are into payments, 
they are into autonomous vehicles, they are into cloud, they are into education, they are 
into healthcare, they are into a whole range of industries,  that’s why Google became 
Alphabet,  to  cater  to  the  broad  range  of  industries.  Same  thing  is  true  of  Amazon.  I 
encourage you to take a sheet of paper and write down, which industries does Amazon 
compete in? And I will bet you that number will be at least 8-10, maybe 11.  

 ISB CTO

What  does  this  tell  us?  That  while  traditional  companies  compete  in  one  or  two 
industries, therefore small scale, in the digital economy, the giants, they compete across 
many industries. That is because they know how to lower the barriers to entry.  

Traditionally, we said only a bank can be a bank, but today, Microsoft, Google, Apple, 
they are all banks. So, digital reality has lowered the barriers to entry. And therefore, it 
is a challenge for every established company to know their competition is not coming 
from their fellow firms in their industry, it is coming from outside. And there are a group 
of companies which move from industry to industry seeking opportunities for innovation, 
disruption,  and  growth.  And  we  call  them  cross-boundary  disruptors.  So,  one  of  the 
aspects of scale is, watch out for new forms of competition because it's not going to 
come increasingly from your traditional rivals. Some implications of scale.  

Third element is speed. By speed we mean, how fast are you moving? We measure 
speed in terms of time to market. Traditionally, it used to take five to six years to produce  
a new car. I mean to design and develop a new car. The pharmaceutical industry, the 
average cycle time for a new drug discovery and commercialisation used to be seven 
years. Today, that's no longer acceptable. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and now Meta 
fame, famously said, "Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking things, you 
are not moving fast enough." Today, speed trumps perfection. Think about it. Why do I 
say that? Because we have traditionally said, get the product perfectly right and then 
go to the market. Today, there's no such thing as perfection because customers’ needs 
will  keep  changing.  Even  if  you  spend  two  years  getting  a  perfect  product,  the 
customers’  needs  might  have  changed.  So,  what's  the  new  paradigm?  Speed  and 
versions  that  every  six  months  to  one  year  customers  taste  will  change.  So,  and 
inevitably, you will have to continually innovate and refresh your product. So, why waste 
time getting it perfect? Because while you are seeking perfection, somebody else will 
move fast.  

This is a lesson learned from the software industry, where speed is important and then 
you  keep  changing  it  through  versions.  How  do  you  do  this?  Increasingly,  the  focus 
must be on open innovation, co-opting your customers to become designers. And more 
importantly, the emergence of what we call strategic A/B experimentation. Meaning that, 
experiment with different versions, see which one is better, launch that, again run an 
experiment.  One  of  the    things  we  will  say  is  that,  in  a  digital  economy,  one  of  the 
important metrics is, how many experiments have you done with customers? Amazon 
and Google, they launch as many as 100 customer experiments, because not every 
experiment is a success, but whether it's a failure or success, it teaches you something 
new. So, speed means move fast, capitalise our opportunities and come back, learn. 
So, it's a continuous cycle of launch, learn, redesign, relaunch. That's what we mean 
by speed.  

So, to summarise, the rule of competition today is aim for scale, aim for scope, aim for 
speed, and aim for all three of these things. This is a huge mindset change for many 
established companies, because they have never really thought like that, or they have 
felt that doing even one of these things is an achievement. But their competition is going 
to come from firms which master all three things simultaneously.

Video 8: Defining Business Strategy 

So, given what we have learnt about the digital reality and the new rules of competition, 
how  should  we  define  business  strategy?  Should  we  redefine  business  strategy?  I 
encourage  you  to  take  a  sheet  of  paper  and  write  down,  what  do  you  understand 
business strategy to be. I am sure you will write down things, such as, business strategy 
is about the customer. Business strategy is about differentiation, business strategy is 
about mission, vision and values. Business strategy is about resources. You would be 
right if you said any one of those things. But today, let's redefine business strategy in 
terms of two concrete ideas, as you are learning how to be a strategy catalyst in your 
role or in an aspiring role to be a Chief Technology Officer.  

First  definition  is  business  strategy  is  a  focus  on  achieving  scale,  scope  and  speed. 
Secondly, business strategy is about imagining or reimagining around customer needs, 
not around your products or services. So, I am going to illustrate that with an example. 
There is a company called John Deere. John Deere has been in the business for nearly 
100  years.  They  manufacture  agricultural  equipment.  And,  they  have  agricultural 
equipment in virtually every farmer's land, not just in the US but across many countries.  

For 100 years, they were synonymous with farming. Yet, global competition, they began 
to run into a challenge, which is, their competitors were no longer in the US or in Europe, 
but they were from Asia. Coming in with much lower cost structure, making it virtually 
difficult for John Deere to sustain its competition, because there's only so much it can 
do  in  a  price-based  competition.  So,  what  should  they  do?  As  they  started  thinking 
about  themselves,  they  realised  that  they  had  thought  about  themselves  as  selling 
agricultural  equipment.  Meaning  that,  they  defined  their  strategy  as,  "We  are  in  the 
business  of  making  and  selling  agricultural  equipment."  Their  insight  was,  "Wait  a 
minute, we are the trusted friend of so many farmers because we know a lot about the 
farmers to whom we have sold agricultural equipment. We know what land do they own. 
We know what kind of weather and soil conditions lie in their lands.  

So, we should really redefine our business away from just selling tractors to becoming 
the trusted advisor to a farmer. Our business should be about farm management." How 
is this helpful? That realisation makes them think about, "So what does the farmer need 
to be effectively managing their farms?" Beyond equipment, they need weather data, 
because farm productivity and yield is subject to the vagaries of nature; weather. If it 
becomes too hot, you'll lose a crop. If it rains too much, you'll lose a crop. In the US, if 
the  frost  comes  early,  in  Florida,  orange  growers  lose  their  whole  crop.  So,  farm 
management  is  very  sensitive  and  vulnerable  to  weather.  So,  can  John  Deere  start 
helping farmers with intelligence about weather, weather maps, weather forecasts, rain, 
humidity, temperature sensors? Something that they would not have done before, but 
an amazing insight.  

But it doesn't stop there. What is the another element of farm management?  Seeds: 
while seeds may be good, the effectiveness depends upon the soil conditions in which 
they  are  planted,  the  acidity,  the  dryness  and  all  those  factors.  So,  what  the  farmer 
really needs is help in seed optimisation. So, can we help them with information built 
through  seed  databases,  farm  performance  databases?  How  do  you  customise  the 

 ISB CTO 

10  

 
   
  
  
seeds  to  your  farm?  Do  you  select  a  particular  seed,  or  do  you  treat  that  seed  in  a 
certain way in order to be optimised for your tract of land? Again, who does this? These 
are really the agricultural scientists. And they are traditionally not the people that John 
Deere  hires,  just  like  John  Deere  does  not  hire  climatologists  or  people  who  study 
weather patterns. Another insight, irrigation. Farmland has to be irrigated. And there are 
dangers  of  over  irrigation,  under  irrigation.  What  is  really  needed  is,  on  one  hand 
conserve water but not wasting it. But the same time, irrigate at the right time in the right 
volume. So, building in field sensors, irrigation nodes, irrigation applications to optimise 
irrigation.  

So,  John  Deere  realised  that agricultural equipment  is only one part.  It gave  them a 
foothold into farmers. But here is an opportunity for them to reimagine their business, 
as we are into farm management. We help a farmer with holistic advice about weather, 
seed and irrigation in addition to providing them with the equipment. And guess what, 
remember we talked about scale? Historically, John Deere had the largest scale. They 
had sold to the largest number of farmers. Which means that they had the most amount 
of intelligence and insight about farmers. They knew much more about farmers than 
any  of  their  competitors,  and  if  they  redefined  their  business  strategy,  then  they  no 
longer  have  to  worry  about  price-based  competitions.  That's  the  new  rule,  and 
hopefully, this is an example that makes sense.  

I  encourage  you  to  think  about  your  own  company  and  ask  yourself  the  following 
question.  What  products  do  we  sell?  What  services  do  we  provide?  Is  that  how  we 
define competition? Who do we serve? Who is that customer? What does that customer 
need?  We  call  this  complementary  consumption.  What  other  products  and  services 
does the customer consume along with our products and service? What are the pain 
points?  What  problems  do  we  solve  for  the  customer?  Can  we  now  become  that 
customer's trusted advisor? And that's what it means to reimagine your business, not 
around your product, but around your customer.    

Video 9: The Rise of Ecosystems 

So, we talked about the new digital reality, the new rules of competition, and the new 
way of imagining competitive strategy. How can you apply this? Is there a framework? 
Are there a set of questions you can ask as a strategy catalyst to help your company 
be ready for the new world order created by the digital reality?  

So, I'm going to build upon the advice from the last segment where we said reimagine 
your business  around your customer. Having  done  so,  focus  your attention on  three 
questions.  First question  is,  what  is your customer value  proposition?  In  the  case  of 
John  Deere,  their  value  proposition  was  "we  provide  excellent  equipment  to  help 
manage farms." That was their traditional value proposition. In there, the word excellent 
means  that  their  product  design  and  quality  is  world  class.  The  choice  of  the  word 
farmers means that they cater to farmers, that's their customer segment.  

So, value proposition is who do you serve? How do you serve? And what makes you 
unique that builds loyalty with that customer? Now, on the basis of that, let's think about 
two ideas about the customer. One is we are going to call it delivered needs and the 

 ISB CTO 

11  

 
   
  
  
second one we will call it latent needs. Delivered needs are what the incumbents in an 
industry  operate  around.  So,  think  about  banks.  Banks  have  a  generally  good  idea 
about what do customers need from a bank. They need a banking account, they need 
a checking account, and traditionally, they need access to an ATM, they need access 
to a branch office.  

So,  that's  the  way  in  which  customers'  needs  are  served.  And  by  the  way,  bank 
customers must have a credit history because that's what the banks want to serve, they 
are safe credit risks. Very often, that means that they serve people who have a steady 
income, who can have a paycheck, right? That's what we call delivered needs, meaning 
that all the incumbents in the banking sector operate the same way. They all serve the 
same customer through the same business model, which is built around ATM networks, 
built around branch offices, friendly, smiling customer agents.  

In  every  industry,  the  incumbents  have  a  well-established  business  model,  and  they 
work according to that business model. There are no secrets, they all know the same 
recipe.  But  the  late  Professor  Clayton  Christensen  of  Harvard  Business  School  did 
some  work  on  why  do  firms  develop  blind  spots  or  why  do  firms  get  disrupted  even 
though they are smart? And his argument was that in every industry, the incumbents 
are serving customers whose needs are well known. But there are customers whose 
needs are either not well known or they are not economical enough to serve, but the 
point  is  therefore  is  that,  in  every  industry,  there  are  customers  who  are  either 
underserved or ignored. That means there are latent needs that are not being served. 
Incumbents do not find it profitable.  

What are a couple of examples? Go back to banking. If you don't have a steady income, 
if you are in the gig economy today and you don't have a steady income, or you're an 
entrepreneur,  you  don't  have  a  steady  income,  or  you  don't  have  a  paycheck,  the 
banking  economy  is  not  available  to  you.  Yet,  there  are  so  many  people  who  have 
financial transaction needs, they buy, they sell, they send money, but they cannot do it 
through the banking system. If somebody finds a way of identifying those customers 
and serving their needs, that's a disruption.  

So,  let's  take  an  example  to  understand  this.  There  is a  company  today  that  you  all 
know very well, it's called Netflix, which is a giant in video streaming business. 20 years 
ago, Netflix did not exist, but there was a giant in video rental industry, it was called 
Blockbuster. Blockbuster had 2000 stores and their value proposition was, you want to 
watch a movie, you come, you'll get a movie. We have a store within a couple of miles 
of where you live. So, we make it very easy and convenient.  

So,  Blockbuster  was  the  giant  and  they  had  the  dominant  market  share.  They  were 
operating on a well-proved model, which is that we have an inventory of popular movies. 
In any store, we can keep let's say 10 copies of a movie, but customers will value the 
convenience that they can walk in and find the movie. Even if they don't find the movie 
they want, we have enough of a selection that they will find something. But in order to 
keep the inventory moving, we have to make sure that they return the movies on time,  
so we let them rent a movie for 24, 48, 72 hours. If they don't send it back in that time, 
we impose a penalty. Not to make money, but in order to make sure that they return 

 ISB CTO 

12  

 
   
  
  
them on time. So, that's the delivered needs model, worked very well. What was wrong 
with this model? First, even though Blockbuster had many selections, they could only 
store so many types of movies,  so they choose to store the popular movies, the more 
recent movies. So, a segment of customers whose needs are, we call them niche are 
not being served, they just cannot find the movie they want.  

Similarly, even for a popular movie, Blockbuster store can only store 10 copies, if you 
are the 11th customer, you are out of luck. So, then you have to search, and the only 
way to search is to walk the aisles, either you find what you are looking for, or you get 
tired, and you pick whatever meets your eye. So, you have already had a suboptimal 
watching experience that day because you are not being served. And then the late fees. 
Many people felt upset about the late fees because their attitude was "I should be able 
to  watch  it  at  my own time, and  I  shouldn't  have  to pay  late  fees." So,  along  comes 
Netflix,  a  startup,  and what  do  they  do?  They  say,  you  know what?  "First thing,  you 
don't need to go to the store, we'll deliver the videos to you in the mail," so convenience.  

Secondly, you can create a list of all the movies you want to watch, and we'll send you 
your top three choices. So, even though if you don't get your top choice, you already 
have thought about what you would like to watch,  so we are satisfying you by giving 
the movies you want to watch. Third, there is no late fees because when we send you 
the movies, as soon as you finish watching them and return them in the mail, we'll send 
you the next set. If you keep them for a week, you won't get the next set. If you return 
them in 48 hours, you'll get the next set. The fourth thing they did, they introduced the 
subscription model, meaning that rather than pay for every movie rental, you pay a fixed 
subscription fee, which at one time was $15 per month. Just imagine the economics. If 
you watch movies regularly and you get the movies in the mail, it takes two days, you 
watch the movie for two days,  3 movies for two days, you return them, that's six days. 
That means in a month, you get those movies five times, that means you watch  5  * 3, 
15 movies for $15. If you rent 15 movies from Blockbuster, you would have typically 
paid 15  * 3, 45 dollars. There is the value proposition.  

So, as customers started discovering Netflix, more and more of them migrated because 
Netflix had identified the latent need, which was not being served. They were relying on 
Blockbuster because that was the only option.  So, in the passage of time, Netflix started 
going this way and Blockbuster stayed flat. So, there was this time where those two 
lines  crossed.  So,  this  is  Netflix  and  Blockbuster  stays  flat,  the  rest  of  the  story  is 
Blockbuster could not recover. Today, nobody knows about Blockbuster.  

So, what's the implication there? While the incumbents are serving well-known needs, 
the delivered needs, there are danger signals of ignoring the latent needs. Same thing 
happened in the book-selling industry. Amazon, why do you need to go to a bookstore 
when we can deliver books to you, via mail? You can go to the internet, order books, 
and we'll deliver it home and we'll do it cheaper. Uber, why do you need to go to a taxi 
stand when we can bring the taxi to you? Again, that's what people wanted, latent need. 
Airbnb, why should you go to a hotel and obey their rules, such as no pets or they are 
not close to where you want to go? Now you can find a listing which is much more suited 
to  your  family,  you  can  cook,  you  can  take  your  pets.  latent  need.  So,  these  are  all 

 ISB CTO 

13  

 
   
  
  
examples of how the new rules of the game are creating disruption, because in every 
industry there are disruptions, threats and opportunities. Why are they there? Because 
consumers  are  finding  their  traditional  experience  to  be  stressful,  intimidating, 
complicated and low trust. People who buy cars complain that going to the dealership 
is painful, they don't trust the dealer, they find it stressful, but there is no other way to 
buy a car. Their dissatisfaction, their latent needs are being ignored. So, if you can sell 
on the internet, that means there's a new business opportunity. Consumer preferences 
are changing, another source of disruption. Today, there are as many people who are 
interested in owning as an equal number of people are preferring to share. Think about 
music.  Some  people  like  I  like  to  buy  the  music  I  like,  my  daughters  they  don't  buy 
anything,  they  rely  on  Spotify.  So,  we  are  beginning  to  see  the  rise  of  two  different 
consumer patterns: sharing and owning, and incumbents are essentially focussed on 
ownership.  

Similarly, in the manufacturing sector, the business model, the OEM business model is 
long, it has got poor visibility and lot of costs and delays. So, as we think about new 
models, such as just-in-time inventory, or think about Apple working with FLEXcon for 
their  production,  there  are  new models  of  how  do  you  organise  your  manufacturing, 
supply  chain  and  operations.  And  finally,  but  equally  importantly,  we  are  seeing  a 
generational shift. Millennials, the ones who were born after 1997, we call them digital 
natives. Why do we call them that? Because they were born. In the times of Amazon, 
Facebook, Google, Apple smartphones. For every firm, their future customers are digital 
natives who believe in the environment, who believe that the purpose of business must 
be to respect the planet as much as profit, who have new forms of consumption more 
aimed at sharing. They are also your younger employees who are coming with a very 
different vision of what they want to do and how they want to innovate. So, how do firms 
recognise that now there are both digital natives and digital immigrants, and therefore, 
are there blind spots? Are there latent needs that we are not paying attention to? Very 
important concepts. I hope you think about them because these are the foundations of 
being a strategy catalyst in a digital economy. 

Video 10: New Ecosystems 

Knowing what we know now, about disruption and latent needs versus delivered needs, 
what's another important lesson and rule of digital strategy that you must think about as 
a strategy catalyst?  

I will introduce you to a new word called ecosystems. Strategy today is about the rise 
of new ecosystems. What do we mean by that? There is a very influential book written 
by Professor Venkatraman. It is called The Digital Matrix, and I am going to build some 
ideas around his work.   

Today,  in  every  industry  there  are  three  sets  of  players.  Every  industry  still  has  the 
incumbents. Maruti in the automobile industry, Hilton and Hyatt in the hotel industry, 
and so on. They operate around the delivered needs. They are the traditional leaders. 
They well understand what the customers need, but they have blind spots, latent needs.   

 ISB CTO 

14  

 
   
  
  
There are two new sets of players in every industry. First of them, we call them digital 
giants.  Who  are  digital  giants?  These  are  the  large  tech  companies  such  as  Apple, 
Amazon,  Facebook,  Google  or  Alphabet,  Netflix,  Uber,  Microsoft,  a  limited  set  of 
companies. What's special about them?  

Remember, we said competition today is achieving scale, scope, and speed, they do 
that. They have amazing financial resources because of their market capitalisation. So, 
they can invest in experiments. They can invest in disruption, they can take risks, which 
most  incumbents  cannot  because  they  have  limited  capital.  They  also  have  a  lot  of 
talent because most of the digital talent, the youngsters and the innovators want to go 
work  for  them.  So,  they  have  the  opportunity  to  focus  upon  disruption  around  latent 
needs because they have the capital to experiment, they have the talent to innovate 
and build.  

So, Google, through its company Waymo, was the one that experimented autonomous 
vehicles  in  the  automobile  industry.  It's  only  then  that  the  others  caught  on.  Apple 
continually  innovates  around  digital  payments  or  digital  music  to  disrupt  different 
industries. So, digital giants are important today because they are disruptors. There's a 
third group, and we call them the digital entrepreneurs. These are the start-ups. Very 
often these are begun by people who are working either for these digital giants or they 
are working for the incumbents. They understand a customer latent need and they also 
have  imagination  about  an  innovative  way of  serving  that  latent need  through digital 
innovation. So, those are the start-ups. 

So,  today  in  every  industry  we  have  the  incumbents,  the  original  leaders,  the  digital 
giants, the disruptors, and the tech entrepreneurs, the new influencers. So, what does 
this mean? It doesn't mean that the digital giants will displace the incumbents. Think 
about  automobiles.  Even  though  Google  experimented  with  the  autonomous  vehicle 
and Tesla experimented with the electric vehicle, even though the early predictions was 
that  Ford,  GM,  BMW,  Audi,  Maruti,  they  will  die,  that's  not  what  happened.  What 
happened is we saw the rise of new ecosystems. Today, when you get into a car, what 
do you find? You find Apple CarPlay, you find Google, you find Bluetooth, and you find 
Information  Services,  which  means  that  every  automobile  company  is  finding  new 
partnerships. They are partnering with Uber, they are partnering with Apple, they are 
partnering with Google, they are partnering with Tesla. Just today, recently, we heard 
that Tesla is partnering with Ford to allow access to its charging stations for people who 
buy Ford electric cars. This is what we call ecosystems.   

So, the new rule of competition is the rise of ecosystems. So, another important concept 
in your thinking as a strategy catalyst is, what are the new ecosystems? Who are the 
new partners? Who are the digital giants and the tech entrepreneurs with whom you 
will  form  partnerships  to  launch  experiments  and  innovations  around  latent  needs? 
That's the new way of thinking about strategy.    

Video 11: Module Summary 

We have learned a lot about different ways of how a CTO can be a strategy catalyst. 
So, how do we summarise what we have learned?  

 ISB CTO 

15  

 
   
  
  
Today,  being  a  strategy  catalyst  means,  being  able  to  educate,  being  able  to 
understand and being able to apply the rules of the new competitive moves for success. 
What are those rules? First, form new ecosystems by identifying who your new partners 
should be. Second, reimagine your business around your customer, amplify the voice 
of  the  customer  and  discover  their  latent  needs.  Third,  leverage  your  ecosystem  for 
strategic experiments to discover opportunities around latent needs that might become 
new  business  opportunities.  And  finally,  leverage  your  ecosystem  to  acquire  new 
capabilities. So, what does that mean? Ford, leveraging its ecosystem to learn how to 
build smart cars, or Ford leveraging a partnership with Uber in order to understand ride 
sharing behaviour because they only traditionally focus on car owners, but what about 
those who don't buy cars but still do ride sharing? So, those are important elements of 
understanding the competitive moves for success.
