In March 2017, Ralph Hamers, chief executive officer (CEO) of ING Groep NV (ING), needed to decide 
how to deal with the many challenges posed by digitization. Despite the positive numbers reported in the 
2016 annual report, the outlook for the bank did not seem certain. Three figures in particular called for 
careful reflection on the future of ING and, more broadly, the banking sector: (1) digital channels already 
accounted for 98 per cent of contact with ING retail customers in 2016; (2) mobile interactions with ING 
retail customers increased by more than 50 per cent during 2016; and (3) a report by Citigroup Inc. showed 
that investments in financial technology (fintech) companies had grown exponentially over the decade— 
from US$1.8 billion in 2010 to $19 billion in 2015—indicating that fintech was rapidly bringing the banking 
sector to a tipping point.2 

In view of the many challenges posed by digitization, Hamers had recently announced that the bank would 
invest  €800 million  in  continued  digital  transformation  to  further  improve  the  customer  experience  and 
accelerate growth.3 While there was no doubt that this investment was needed, Hamers had to decide how 
ING  would  respond  to  and  take  advantage  of  the  radical  changes  that  would  likely  further  disrupt  the 
banking sector. Which strategic actions were most needed for the bank to thrive in the digital disruption? 
Which specific initiatives should Hamers prioritize for the €800 million investment? 

THE HISTORY AND GROWTH  OF ING  

ING  was  the  product  of  a  merger  between  insurance  company  Nationale-Nederlanden  and  banking 
company NMB Postbank Groep in 1991. The new bank was initially named Internationale Nederlanden 
Groep, which the market immediately abbreviated to I-N-G, so the company formally changed its name to 
ING Group. Within a few years of its foundation, ING had rapidly expanded its range of activities through 
a combination of organic growth and a series of acquisitions. ING had evolved from a Dutch company with 
limited international activities to a large multinational with operations across several countries. By the end 
of 2016, as a global financial institution with a strong European base, ING offered banking services in more 
than 40 countries and employed over 54,000 people worldwide. The bank had 35.8 million customers and 
the ING brand ranked 27th on the list of the most valuable bank brands in the world.4 

Over the years, ING had segmented its geographical markets. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg 
(the market leaders) constituted its key markets. ING had a strong position in both retail and wholesale

banking  in  these  countries.  Germany,  Austria,  Spain,  Italy,  France,  Australia,  and  the  Czech  Republic 
constituted the challengers. ING mainly offered retail direct-banking with strong savings franchises in these 
countries and showed potential for growth in wholesale banking. In Poland, Turkey, Romania, and selected 
countries in Asia (the growth markets), ING provided a full range of retail and wholesale banking services. 
Although the bank did not hold large shares of that market, its businesses were characterized by strong 
growth potential. ING only had wholesale banking activities in the other countries where it had operations.5 

According to its 2016 annual report, ING was committed to achieving sustainable progress and empowering 
its customers to make informed financial decisions. The bank defined its purpose as “empowering people 
to stay a step ahead in life and in business.” This purpose was embedded in four promises ING made to 
provide its increasingly digital and self-directed customers a differentiating experience: “to be clear and 
easy, with an anytime, anywhere service offering that empowers customers to make smart decisions” and 
“to keep getting better.”6 Clear and easy reflected the bank’s efforts to save its clients both time and money 
by providing clear products and striving for plain language, fair pricing, and simple processes. Anytime, 
anywhere  represented  ING’s  work  to  get  its  services  to  where  its  customers  were,  giving  them  the 
possibility  of  accessing  banking  services  at  their  convenience.  Empowering  meant  providing  customers 
with relevant, up-to-date information about their choices and related short- and long-term implications. ING 
believed  that  the  best  financial  decisions  were  informed  decisions.  And  finally,  keep  getting  better 
corresponded  to  the  bank’s  efforts  to  make  its  customers’  lives  easier  with  new  ideas,  solutions,  and 
approaches. With improvements, both ING and its customers could stay ahead. 

ING had a successful year in 2016, showing strong growth in customer numbers, savings, and lending. The 
bank was also recognized by The Banker as 2016’s global bank of the year and bank of the year for Western 
Europe,  the  Netherlands,  and  Belgium.  Since  Hamers  was  appointed  CEO  and  chairman  on  October  1, 
2013, ING had been reporting increasingly positive results, which confirmed the bank’s sound competitive 
position in the market.7 

ING’s Competitive Position 

One of ING’s key strengths was its branding: ING was a well-known, strong brand with positive recognition 
from customers across multiple countries. The bank also enjoyed a strong capital and liquidity position, and 
a solid financial and operating performance. The omni-channel distribution strategy that ING had adopted 
years before had been successful in growing the number of customers. Moreover, ING had been one of the 
first traditional banks to invest in digital platforms, which proved to be a significant advantage, with the 
bank acquiring precious experience in the digital environment. 

A weakness for ING was its dependence on interest income. It needed more agility to compete in the new 
environment and needed more efficiencies to remain profitable in the future. The bank also faced challenges 
with different market positions in the various markets in which ING had operations. Moreover, its global 
presence meant the bank had to deal with varying customer needs and regulatory environments; adapting 
to these distinct environments was still a costly element of ING’s operations.  

Further improving its customers’ experience would give ING the opportunity to grow faster than the market. 
To offer a differentiating customer experience, the bank needed to leverage its scale and early experience 
with digital platforms to invest in new digital technologies.  

A major threat was further disruption caused by digitization, which exposed the banks to cybercrimes. ING 
also faced growing competition from new entrants to the market, such as fintech companies. As well, the

financial sector generally had an unfavourable image in many countries, and the regulatory environment was 
becoming increasingly complex, heightening the execution risk. To resolve the latest capital requirements of 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the bank still needed to accumulate more capital.8 

In an assessment of the competitive challenges lying ahead for ING, Hamers stated, 

Customers are increasingly digital and bank with us more and more through mobile devices. Their 
needs and expectations are the same, all over the world, and they expect us to adopt new technology 
as fast as companies in other sectors. In order to continue to lead in digital banking, we need to 
offer a better customer experience that’s instant, personal, frictionless and relevant. At the same 
time, banks are confronted with continuous regulatory burden and a prolonged period of ultra-low 
interest rates. These factors put pressure on the returns which are necessary to fund growth and 
investments, and [to] cover our cost of capital.9 

DIGITAL DISRUPTION  IN THE BANKING SECTOR 

Digital technology was affecting all aspects of life, and digitization was responsible for considerable large-
scale  changes  in  the  business  environment.  It  led  to  greater  efficiency  and  significant  innovation  as 
companies  responded  to  the  changes  digitization  made  to  the  way  companies  operated  and  customers 
experienced  products  and  services.  Companies  were  called  to  radically  transform  themselves  to  remain 
competitive. The digital transformation project launched by the World Economic Forum reported, 

Becoming a digital enterprise requires far more profound changes than merely investing in the latest 
digital  technologies.  Companies  will  need  to  search  for  new  business  models,  fundamentally 
rethink their operating models, revamp how they attract and foster digital talent, and consider afresh 
how they measure the success of their business.10 

Accenture  highlighted  that  digital  disruption  had  been  occurring  at  every  single  level  in  the  banking 
industry, and the other major consultancy companies corroborated this.11 Customers had increased their 
expectations and changed the way they wanted to communicate  with their banks and make use of their 
services. New digital technologies had given banks the opportunity to revolutionize their business models, 
creating digital platforms for their clients, introducing new products, and increasing their efficiency levels. 
New entrants characterized by their heavy reliance on digital technologies—the fintech companies—had 
started  offering  financial  services  to  their  customers,  representing  a  growing  threat  to  the  once  secure 
revenue streams of traditional banks. According to Accenture estimates, by 2020, different business models 
would impact up to 80 per cent of the revenues the banking sector made in 2016.12 

An analysis for the World Economic Forum listed five key developments that had contributed to the radical 
transformation of the banking sector: Consumers had lost their trust in the traditional banking system after 
the global financial crisis of 2008. Clients’ expectations were increasing as the clients became accustomed 
to  faster  and  more  convenient  experiences,  mainly  as  a  result  of  the  digital  transformation.  The 
millennials—an  entirely  new  demographic—had  different  expectations  and  a  stronger  technological 
orientation than older segments of the population. Use of the mobile Internet was on the rise; consumers 
were always connected and were widening the range of services they accessed through their smartphones. 
Generally, the financial sector was already tightly regulated, but several countries had further enhanced 
their regulations to protect consumers’ rights.13

The Rise of  Fintech  

9B18M052 

Numerous  analyses  indicated  that  one  of  the  phenomena  related  to  digitization  in  the  financial  services 
sector  was  the  rise  of  fintech  companies—businesses  that  offered  financial  services  by  making  use  of 
software and modern technology.14 They competed directly with banks in most areas of the financial sector. 
These  companies  realized  that  financial  services  of  all  kinds  (money  transfers,  lending,  investing,  and 
payments) were better when integrated with the increasingly digitalized lives of customers. 

The  explosion  of  fintech  companies  was  disrupting  the  banking  industry,  with  the  phenomenon  mostly 
affecting American and European banks. A Citigroup report showed that investments in fintech companies 
had grown exponentially over the previous decade, from $1.8 billion in 2010 to $19 billion in 2015. The report 
predicted that the rise and development of fintech would soon bring the banking world to a tipping point.15 

The majority of investments in financial technology were being made to facilitate payments, such as those 
required for online invoicing and purchases.16 Online services with payment options and mobile phones with 
direct money transfer functions were only some of the digital options that were offered to consumers. The 
result was that fewer customers were likely to walk into a bank for financial services and fewer employees 
would be required. Citigroup predicted that up to 30 per cent of employees in banks across Europe and the 
United States could lose their jobs by 2025, primarily as a result of the automation of retail banking.17 

Traditional  banks  still  had  the  advantage  of  scale;  however,  only  about  1  per  cent  of  North  American 
consumer banking revenues had moved to new digital models by 2017, and this percentage was likely to 
grow exponentially. Fintech companies had already gained considerable market shares beyond the United 
States. For example, in China, Internet giants moved very early into financial services and gained significant 
market  shares  in  e-commerce  as  well  as  in  third-party  payments.  Building  on  the  extensive  knowledge 
acquired  in  the  digital  world,  these  companies  were  able  to  rapidly  create  convenient,  quick,  and  cost-
efficient alternatives to traditional bank payments.18 

Although the financial industry was generally known for its relatively tight regulations, variations did occur 
from country to country, and the same was true of the regulators’ responses to the rise and growth of fintech. 
For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched Project Innovate in 
2014  to  work  with  innovative  businesses  in  regulated  sectors.  The  same  approach  was  followed  by 
Singapore and Australia. However, in some countries, a company was still required to be a formal “bank” 
even to offer one financial activity, such as payments.19 

DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AT ING  

Despite the positive financial results and reassuring awards obtained in 2016, ING was aware that its future, 
and the future of all traditional banks, was threatened by digitization. Hamers acknowledged the risk and 
the need for change just a few months after releasing the bank’s 2016 annual report. In an interview in New 
York City, he declared, “We want to be a tech company with a banking license.”20 Clearly, Hamers was 
indicating  that  the  bank  had  already  begun  to  adjust  its  strategy  to  remain  competitive  in  the  resulting 
fundamental transformation digitization was causing in the banking sector. 

The primary goal of ING’s transformation and €800 million investment in digitization was to enhance the 
experience of its customers with an integrated digital platform that catered to all of its customers’ financial 
needs and to provide new digital tools that made their financial planning and decision making easier. For 
example, My Money Coach, launched in 2016 in Spain, was a free digital adviser that helped customers create 
a personalized plan to achieve their savings, investment, and retirement goals. In Poland, ING launched a

customer lending application that used advanced analytics to approve applications from existing customers 
and allowed customers to secure loans in minutes. ING developed similar tools for its customers in Belgium, 
France, and the Netherlands. ING had also worked on transforming its wholesale banking division, expanding 
the reach of its digital cross-border banking platform, InsideBusiness, which gave customers real-time insights 
and a single point of access to manage all their financial operations. The bank intended to merge its platforms 
as rapidly as possible to a single digital and scalable banking platform across countries.21 

The bank seemed to be focusing on three areas for its digital transformation. The first focus was improving 
customer experience by engaging clients through their new necessities and habits. Hamers was convinced 
that  ING  needed  to  be  where  people  were.  He  described  the  change  by  talking  about  his  own  banking 
experience as a client:  

I was in the line-up, 20 people ahead of me. None of them were talking. All of them were right 
here—on their mobile phone! This is where people spend their lives these days. . . . They’re not on 
the street. You can’t reach them with your branches. They have no interest. They’re spending their 
lives on social media. Posting their blogs, making their comments, posting their pictures. They’re 
buying stuff on Amazon.22 

The second area of focus dealt with the rise of fintech companies. Hamers believed that ING had to deal 
with this new form of competition while finding a way to learn from them: 

Doing  their  personal  finances  is  no  one’s  hobby—not  even  mine.  People  need  banking  but  not 
necessarily banks. And a new breed of financial services competitor has emerged to meet that need: 
the fintechs. There’s much to learn from these new competitors.23 

The third area of focus was similar, but broader: ING needed to come to terms with the fundamental role 
technology  and  innovation  were  playing  in  the  future  of  banks.  Hamers  understood  that,  and  he  also 
understood the need for talent who could deal with it: 

Banking is becoming more of a technology play than a content play, with people who have a lot of 
knowledge about a specific product. The product is not what differentiates you as a bank, it’s the 
experience that differentiates you as a bank. Your experience more than ever before is in how you 
deliver in a digital way, how quickly and easily you can deliver, and how real time the information 
is, because clients want instant satisfaction. They’re used to that through Facebook, through all of 
their Internet experiences. Instant satisfaction is what is needed. Now, knowing that, you know that 
you have to attract more and more talent on the technology side of things.24 

ING’S FUTURE 

Digitization  and  changing  customer  needs  were  clearly  affecting  the  whole  financial  services  sector, 
including ING. As in other industries that had been disrupted, consumers were becoming accustomed to 
and  expecting  a  better,  digitally  enhanced  experience.  In  an  industry  such  as  banking,  where  trust  and 
loyalty had been key in attracting and retaining customers, there was a diminishing need for personal contact 
as  people  increasingly  managed  their  financial  transactions  digitally.  This  turned  banking  products  into 
commodities, making differentiation significantly more complicated for banks. Moreover, as in many other 
industries, consumer loyalty was decreasing: customers were often turning away from their well-known 
and trusted banks to small, newly established companies that provided financial services at lower costs in 
a more digitally friendly way.

ING, being a multinational that operated in over 40 countries, had to cope with these challenges in very 
different country settings. The differences between countries made it even more difficult for the bank to 
respond to current trends. Investing in digital solutions was also likely to affect the bank’s future need for 
human  resources,  reducing  the  need  for  staff  across  countries.  Dismissing  a  significant  number  of 
employees would surely hurt the bank’s reputation among consumers, especially in established markets 
such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. 

How  would  ING  take  on  these  challenges  and  take  advantage  of  the  radical  changes  that  would  likely 
continue to disrupt the banking sector? Which strategic actions were most needed for the bank to continue 
thriving in the face of the digital disruption? How should Hamers prioritize the initiatives for his announced 
investment of €800 million?
