BACKGROUND 

A  famous  proverb  states,  ‘To  err  is  human’.  However,  some  errors  are  easily  avoidable  and  simply 
inhumane:  for  instance,  poorly  written  prescriptions  and  wrong  diagnoses.  Even  though  healthcare 
spending is expected to exceed 10% of GDP in many countries by 2030, digitalisation in healthcare has 
fallen  behind.1  Compared  to  high  digitalisation  rates  in  other  industries  (e.g.,  finance,  etc.),2  the  global 
healthcare sector has reached only a low to medium level of digitalisation.3  Even India has fallen short in 
healthcare digitalisation, despite being a world leader in exporting IT services.4 

India  faces  a  huge  shortage  of  doctors.5  Hundreds  of  millions  of  patients,  including  those  with  chronic 
illnesses,  are  taken  care  of  by  a  mere  300,000  practicing  specialists.  A  typical  conversation  between  a 
doctor and their patient, which includes the diagnosis, the treatment decision, and the medical prescription, 
is made in an average consulting time of around two minutes.6  Doctors are challenged to review medical 
history, do paperwork, connect and build a relationship with their patients within just a few minutes. What’s 
worse, the abbreviation of instructions, mindboggling array of drug brands, illegible handwriting, and other 
confounding  factors  all  place  a  speed  bump  on  the  road  to  curing  patients;  in  fact,  these  increase  the 
incidence of medical errors and even patient deaths.

To improve healthcare in India and create a product with a “doctors-first” approach, HealthPlix was founded 
in 2014. HealthPlix is a health-tech company in India that provides a platform used by doctors to improve 
the  efficiency  of  treatments  and the  productivity  of  doctors. It  is  common  to  provide  patients  with  digital 
healthcare services, but few technologies focus on the perspective of doctors. In India, most doctors own 
or run their private practice, and serving this unorganised sector is novel and challenging at the same time. 
The company  has  managed to get doctors  to eschew  pen and paper prescriptions in favour of a cloud-
based  digital  platform  with  many  functionalities,  including  electronic  medical  records  (EMR),  online 
consultation,  appointment  management,  patient  analytics,  billing,  medicine  inventory  management,  and 
follow-up  visit  reminder  services.  It  aims  to  break  down  barriers  between  doctors  and  patients  using 
innovative tools, which are designed by putting doctors in the centre of their product development. 

HEALTHPLIX’S APPROACHES TO CURRENT CHALLENGES 

“Doctors are at the core of healthcare delivery, and at the core of a doctor’s day is his interaction with the 
patient. This interaction is the moment of truth, where $88 billion of annual healthcare spend is decided. 
And in this moment of truth, the only solution that doctors turn to for assistance is HealthPlix." 
- Sandeep Gudibanda, co-founder and CEO of HealthPlix 

Since  its  inception,  HealthPlix  has  attempted  to  address  the  following  challenges  faced  by  doctors  and 
patients: 

Unclear Handwritten Prescriptions 

Illegible handwriting on prescriptions negatively affects patients’ experience and may even cause adverse 
outcomes for patients if pharmacists dispense the wrong drugs (see Exhibit 1 for an example of illegible 
handwritten prescription). The Institute of Medicine (IOM), USA, issued a report, “To Err is Human: Building 
a Safer Health System”, revealing that illegible prescriptions had caused a number of deaths.7 

There are several reasons behind illegible prescriptions. First, doctors are busy. They need to diagnose 
and write each prescription in about two minutes due to heavy caseloads.8  Furthermore, before making a 
diagnosis, doctors need to review patients’ historical medical records (possibly written by other doctors). 
Patients  who  have  no  such  records  available  or  have  previous  medical  records  that  were  written  in  an 
unclear  manner  may  understandably  be given  inaccurate  or  incomplete diagnoses  by  doctors  who  rush 
through the process. 

Second, to save time, doctors use many confusing abbreviations. To address the problems arising from 
this, in September 2016, the Medical Council of India (MCI) amended a clause in the Indian Medical Council 
Regulations to state: “Every physician should prescribe drugs with generic names legibly and preferably in 
capital letters and he/she shall ensure that there is a rational prescription and use of drugs”.9 This has made 
the prescription writing process more time-consuming for doctors. 

Roadblock to Digitalisation 

The digitalisation of prescriptions and medical records promises to solve many problems in the healthcare 
industry  in  India  and  improve  overall  patient  outcomes  by  eliminating  human  error  arising  from  unclear 
handwritten documents.

HealthPlix  is  one  of  India’s  largest  providers  of  electronic  medical  records  (EMR)  solutions  for  doctors. 
Using HealthPlix’s system, a digital prescription may be generated in less than 30 seconds on average.10 

The  system  has  several  key  features.11  First,  doctors  can  create  templates  for  common  diagnoses  and 
repeated  cases:  this  is  especially  useful  for  return  visits  of  patients  with  chronic  diseases.  Second,  the 
system uses machine learning algorithms that can assist doctors in writing prescriptions more quickly. The 
system learns words and phrases that are commonly used by each doctor in recording patients’ 
chief complaint and diagnosis, so that when the doctor enters the first few letters, the system automatically 
engages in word association and suggests the full spelling of the word (Exhibit 2 shows how the system 
adapts to doctors’ practice). Third, the prescription can be printed in 14 regional languages and sent via 
SMS and email for patients’ understanding and personal medical records (see Exhibit 3 for a sample of 
HealthPlix’s  e-prescription).  Fourth,  the  system  predicts  if  a  prescribed  medicine  may  trigger  an  allergic 
reaction in a patient and gives timely warnings when patients have been prescribed medicines that may be 
harmful when used in combination with one another. 

No-Shows by Patients 

Regular  check-ups  are  critical  to  positive  healthcare  outcomes  (especially  in  monitoring  and  controlling 
chronic diseases). Patients’ health conditions and treatment plans may change over time, but patients may 
not  take  the  appropriate  steps  to  manage  their  evolving  health  conditions  if  they  miss  their  follow-up 
appointments. 

A survey found that 36% of patients had adverse health outcomes resulting solely from noncompliance with 
follow-up calls and from not adhering to treatment regimens.12  Furthermore, following up with patients is 
important  for doctors  to build a strong and  healthy relationship with their  patients. Missed appointments 
also have considerable time and cost implications because doctors would otherwise be available to serve 
other patients. 

Reasons  that  patients  fail  to attend scheduled  appointments  include forgetting  appointments,  conflicting 
schedules,  inability  to  travel  to  clinics,  and  so  on.  In  most  clinics  in  India,  patients’  appointments  are 
managed on paper and it is time-consuming for healthcare personnel to make reminder calls to patients. 

Increase in Online Medical Consultations 

COVID-19  has  significantly  increased  the  demand  for  online  medical  consultations.  Doctors  have  many 
tools at their disposal to schedule and deliver online consultations. However, switching between devices, 
keeping patient records, and setting up meetings are all time-consuming processes. 

HealthPlix’s  solution  to  this  is  its  integrated  platform  for  online  and  offline  consultations,  open 
communication  channels,  patient  record  management,  and  appointment  scheduling.  Doctors  can  send 
reminders via SMS, WhatsApp, or email to remind patients of their scheduled follow-up visits (see Exhibit 
4 for HealthPlix’s SMS and email reminders). This has improved the follow-up rate by 31%.13 Also, patients 
can book consultations and ask follow-up questions using the HealthPlix portal/smartphone application. 

During lockdowns, patients can consult doctors via video or audio means using HealthPlix’s virtual clinic 
function (see Exhibit 5 for Dr. Vinesh Jain’s post on  online consultations during COVID-19 lockdowns).

Furthermore, HealthPlix has launched ROBIN (a.k.a. the Doctors Insights Dashboard),14 a tool that assists 
doctors  in  tracking  critical  aspects  of  their  patients’  health  by  providing  data-driven  insights.  It  provides 
doctors  with  patient  demographics,  comparison  and  analysis  of  patient  visit  trends,  and  insights  around 
follow-ups; these help doctors better manage their clinic and improve the follow-up visit rate.15 

Lack of Customisation 

Doctors in different disciplines and specialisations have different needs for their EMR system. For example, 
a paediatrician would want to keep track of a baby’s immunisations, developmental milestones, and growth, 
whereas a cardiologist would be more focused on a patient’s heart health metrics. This makes EMR design 
a challenge. HealthPlix has adopted an exhaustive cloud-based solution, which is customised at the doctor 
level. Doctors are continuously testing system features, and their feedback is integrated into the next stage 
of system design. This helps to create a fully customisable stack for doctors. As a result, HealthPlix is able 
to  cater  to  many  specialised  practices.  Due  to  the  cloud-based  core  tool,  any  new  development  are 
immediately available to all doctors. 

HEALTHPLIX’S LANDSCAPE 

HealthPlix’s  primary  market  is  the  fragmented  Indian  healthcare  industry,  in  which  most  doctors  have 
private practices and private hospitals typically have some form of EMR. Most doctors in India have their 
own  private  practice,  even  if  they  are  employed  by  a  private  hospital  (or  private  medical  group).  These 
doctors  usually  have  one clinic  with  an  attached pharmacy, one  or two  beds,  as  well  as  a  small  lab for 
simple tests. There are also hundreds of small clinics in India in which a few doctors share a single space. 
EMR systems are needed to streamline the clinic’s operations, such as scheduling, record keeping, sending 
patient reminders, and maintaining medicine stocks. 

Doctors  typically  prefer  a  simple,  installation-free  browser-based  EMR  system  which  require  just  a 
computer, a printer, and a stable internet connection to get started. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-empowered, 
cloud-based  services  have  gained  significant  traction  with  doctors  who  are  key  opinion  leaders  in  the 
healthcare  industry  - 25%  of  cardiologists,  80%  of  endocrinologists,  56%  of  nephrologists,  82%  of 
diabetologists, and 13% of neurologists in India (see Exhibit 6) use HealthPlix’s system to generate nearly 
1.3 million prescriptions per month.16  According to a user named Dr. Modi, the best part of an assistive-AI 
powered product is  when he “gets positive feedback  from the patients”. Similarly, a testimonial from Dr. 
Chandra  states:  “HealthPlix  is  a  user-friendly  EMR  and  has  helped  me  in  streamlining  my  outpatient 
department treatment (OPD) data and connecting my clinic with patients”. 

HealthPlix’s  dedicated  on-ground team  approaches  doctors  in  person  and  provides  demonstrations  and 
information about their products. Once a doctor agrees to try out the system, a dedicated team member will 
train the doctors and relevant staff. In addition, a dedicated HealthPlix staff member will be stationed at the 
doctor’s clinic to provide technical support for several days. 

Besides the web-based solution, HealthPlix also provides the HealthPlix SPOT App for doctors to provide 
more individualised attention to patients17  (see Exhibit 7 for an example). The app allows doctors to not 
only  resolve  follow-up  questions  from  patients  while  having  the  patient  information  and  medical  history

readily  available,  but  also  provide  chronic  care  management  including  online  consultations  and 
appointment management. 

HealthPlix has two ways to generate revenue. First, HealthPlix charges doctors for the EMR platform and 
additional functions such as pharmacy inventory management and SMS reminder services (doctors need 
to purchase SMS credits before they can send SMS reminders to their patients). Pharmaceutical companies 
sometimes sponsor doctors to use its EMR platform as digitalised EMR data is essential for pharmaceutical 
research: it helps pharmaceutical companies better understand the prescription behaviour of doctors, which 
can  lead  to  future  sales  as  well  as  research  directions.  In  a  nutshell,  HealthPlix’s  e-prescription  and 
pharmacy inventory management system enables market insights for pharmaceutical firms. 

HealthPlix  has  a  stringent  data  protection  policy.  The  platform  only  delivers  aggregated  insights  to  its 
pharmaceutical  clients.  Data-driven  insights  from  the  platform  help  doctors  to  have  more  meaningful 
discussions with these pharmaceutical companies as well as to conduct their own research. 

Second,  HealthPlix  charges  advertisement  fees  to  pharmaceutical  companies.  To  increase  platform 
adoption  rates,  doctors  are  offered  the  option  use  a  free  version  of  HealthPlix’s  platform,  which  will 
occasionally  show  articles  from  pharmaceutical  companies.  Prescription  drugs  are  not  allowed  to  be 
advertised in India. However, doctors are able to find out more about drugs that may be relevant for their 
practice through information tiles that are built into HealthPlix’s tools. This in turn acts as a communication 
channel between pharmaceutical companies and doctors. Through HealthPlix’s platform, pharmaceutical 
companies are able to deliver information about approved therapies that align with doctor specialties and 
patient needs in a fast, effective, and non-intrusive way. 

Given the state of healthcare in India, there is still a long way to go. Although HealthPlix was able to succeed 
in  its  initial  launch  phase,  its  team  is  continually  working  to  address  several  challenges  and  work  out  a 
roadmap to continued success. As a management consultant to the CEO of HealthPlix, understanding their 
unique challenges and potential future plans, what would you recommend to HealthPlix? Specifically, how 
should they address the challenges they face and what strategies should they adopt to succeed in their 
future plans? 

The following paragraphs describe the current challenges faced by HealthPlix. 

CHALLENGES FACED BY HEALTHPLIX 

HealthPlix’s future growth is dependent on its ability to resolve several of the following challenges. 

Stagnant Conversion Ratio 

One of HealthPlix’s key challenges is to win over doctors who are reluctant to adopt its system. Although 
digitalisation  can  save  time  and  solve  many  problems  arising  from  paperwork  and  unclear  handwriting, 
some doctors still believe that maintaining pen and paper records take less time than entering data into a 
digital system. This is particularly evident in the first few days of adoption, due to the inevitable learning 
curve in using a new system. However, as asserted by one of HealthPlix’s sales team members, “If a doctor 
can continuously use our system for seven days, we are 90% sure that the doctor will continue to use our 
product”. Being able to overcome such myopic beliefs and doctors’ default bias is the key driver in improving 
system adoption. 

Infrastructure Requirement 

HealthPlix’s system requires some infrastructure in place. For example, users must have a computer (that 
meets the minimum operating requirements), a printer, and a stable internet connection. On top of that, it

is recommended to engage a front office staff trained to use the HealthPlix platform to help doctors save 
time in doing data entry and appointment management. Finally, as healthcare data are sensitive in nature, 
data protection tools and specialised IT staff may be required. The infrastructural requirement increases 
manifold if a doctor practices in multiple clinics, and the necessary investment may be prohibitive for doctors 
practising in Tier 2 and rural areas. 

Higher Customisation Needs 

Doctors  need  the  system  to  be  customisable  so  that  it  can  be  tailored  to  the  needs  of  their  practice. 
HealthPlix’s system provides customisable templates and uses machine learning algorithms to learn and 
autofill each doctor’s frequently used words to reduce the time required to write a prescription. There is also 
the possibility of customising other functionalities of the system to meet the individual requirements of a 
doctor’s practice. With so many customisations available, users may be confused by the platform. As such, 
HealthPlix’s team has to make trade-offs between customisability and simplicity of the tool. 

Number of Languages 

India  is  a  multi-language  country  with  English  as  the  lingua  franca  (with  varying  proficiency  levels 
nationwide)  and  22  official  non-English  languages.18  As  per  Indian  law,  doctors  in  India  need  to  write 
medicine names in English. However, given the mind-boggling number of languages spoken in India, it may 
be challenging to communicate instructions on how to take these medications as well as other advice in a 
manner that is effective and comprehensive. 

Doctors  may  encounter  language  barriers  when  conversing  with patients.  As  such, patients may  not be 
able  to  convey  the  full  picture  of  their  health  conditions  to  medical  service  providers,  access  medical 
services independently, or adequately understand information pertaining to prescriptions, follow-up plans, 
and doctors’ advice. 

To address this issue, HealthPlix’s platform supports 14 languages. The company is working on making 
more and more local languages available. This effort has been received well by doctors and patients, and 
HealthPlix  intends  to  continue  expanding  the  number  of  supported  languages.  That  said,  the  resources 
taken by this effort need to be carefully balanced with its impact, and it may take time for doctors who do 
not typically face any language-related challenges to see its value. 

Remaining Competitive in the Marketplace 

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of healthcare and resulted in a large 
number  of  healthcare  start-ups.  With  the  increase  in  competition,  maintaining  a  competitive  edge  and 
thriving remains an ongoing endeavour. HealthPlix’s competitors include Docon19, Navia Life Care20, and 
other healthcare start-ups. 

These  firms  differentiate  their  product  features  to  attract  doctors  who  have  different  preferences.  For 
example, Docon provides functions such as appointment booking, alerts for public holidays, and working 
hours of the clinics in its networks. Navia Life Care, which offers AI-enabled voice assistants, has equipped 
doctors with smart pens and paper that allow them to continue writing prescriptions and medical records, 
eliminating the need for typing data into their EMR system.

WHAT SHOULD HEALTHPLIX DO? 

So far, more than 15 million patients have been served through the HealthPlix platform by thousands of 
doctors  practicing  across  16  specialties.  The  company  maintains  a  doctor  base  and  geographic  spread 
across over 370 cities.21 On average, over 10,000 doctors use the platform every day. As one of the largest 
EMR platforms in India with wide coverage across specialties and geographies, HealthPlix aims to grow 
eightfold in two years.22  It will continue to invest heavily in tools and technologies that promise to improve 
efficiency, scalability, and reliability of the platform – and thus, of doctors’ practices. There are a few notable 
works in the future, namely: 

HealthPlix is working on a speciality module for paediatricians. The paediatric module enables immunisation 
tracking,  growth  charts  for  toddlers  and  infants,  development  charts,  and  paediatric  care  plans  for 
customised care. 

Currently, HealthPlix targets doctors in metropolitan areas. In the near future, HealthPlix aims to expand its 
reach to Tier 2 cities and start entering rural areas. An improved Doctors’ Insight Dashboard, ROBIN, to 
provide doctors with data analytics pertaining to prescriptions and to facilitate research. A mobile app for 
doctors  to  make  its  tools  available  on  the  go.  Improved  AI  capabilities  to  create  pre-filled  prescriptions 
accurately. 

On the day of HealthPlix’s board meeting to discuss its future plans, Sandeep, the co-founder and CEO of 
HealthPlix, arrived at the meeting room early and prepared himself to listen to ideas from team members 
with an open mind. 

As the meeting commenced, Nithin Chowhan, Lead Performance Marketing of HealthPlix, presented a flow 
chart explaining how HealthPlix has changed its consultation process. “Generally, a consultation process 
includes registration, consultation, prescription, billing, and medicine collection. Appointments for follow-up 
visits  will  be  made  if  needed.  Doctors  spend  too  much  time  documenting  patient  information  into  EMR 
systems and, as a result, are constantly falling behind on their schedules. Patients spend most of their time 
waiting for the consultation. Our EMR system digitalises the entire process and integrates AI techniques to 
the prescription,” he said.

Figure 2: Consultation Process after HealthPlix Platform Implementation

“However, we were challenged by the drop-off in doctors’ use. Through our data analysis, about 60% of 
doctors  reduced  their  use  frequency  after  seven  days  of  adoption.  Some  doctors  feel  that  creating  e-
prescriptions is more time-consuming than writing them by hand. According to their feedback, our machine 
learning algorithm could be further improved. Sometimes, our word-association system needs doctors to 
type seven or more characters to suggest the full drug name. Therefore, I suggest investing in improving 
existing features, such as advanced algorithm construction that allows doctors to type fewer characters to 
write the prescription, for instance, maximum three characters to find a drug name.” 

“As you all know, we have successfully raised $13.5 million as part of Series B funding. This enables us to 
expand our doctor base in existing geographies, adding new towns and medical specialities, and bolstering 
our team and product.” Sandeep continued. “Let us remember that our products and services should be 
developed sustainably. We should develop sustainable strategies to improve our competitiveness and have 
better long-term results.” 

Prashant, head of the Doctor Growth Function, followed with his thoughts. “Shouldn’t we add more features 
to attract more doctors? It is possible that our available features cannot meet their needs or customisation 
requirements. First, I suggest adding an appointment management system to enable doctors to manage 
bookings for particular time slots to reduce no-show rates. Second, the number of languages in the system 
could be increased as there are 23 official languages in our country. We need to think about which language 
to add next. Third, to encourage doctors’ use frequency and improve doctors’ communications, a doctors’ 
network could be established in our system, providing a platform for doctors to connect with each other.” 

Sanatomba, from the Doctor Growth Department, brought up another interesting perspective. “When we 
are shortlisting doctors for pitching our product, we should not just collect data but also see how they work. 
For instance, when I see a doctor with a laptop, I am very confident pitching our products to that doctor, 
with a high likelihood of acceptance. Similarly, we should think and observe such behavioural patterns in 
doctors to increase the free-trial period. This will help us improve our lead generation process.” 

“I think we need to factor in the external challenges too.” A comment came in from Chaitanya, HealthPlix’s 
Chief of AI, who was primarily concerned about the firm’s strategy. “Our main competitors include Docon, 
Navia Life Care, and so on. Some of them are developing characteristic features. For example, Navia Life 
Care  digitalises  handwritten  prescriptions  with  a  smart  pen-and-pad  to  build  EMR  automatically.  It  also 
offers voice-enabled assistance for doctors. These technologies may attract doctors who are reluctant to 
do  computer  work.  Additionally,  other  health-tech  companies  generate  machine  learning-driven  dosage 
suggestions.  Perhaps  we  should  take  these  competitors’  strategies  into  consideration  to  develop  our 
features and improve our competitiveness.” 

Sandeep noted the points raised in the meeting and left the room with questions in his mind: How would
