Nike: 
Tiptoeing into the Metaverse 

In  January  2022,  Nike’s  chief  digital  information  ofcer,  Ratnakar  Lavu,  was  planning  the 
year’s digital strategy for Nike. Te leadership team at Nike had requested a presentation regarding 
company strategy in the rapidly evolving metaverse. Nike had already made several forays into the 
metaverse and related digital products. Tese included an in-game collaboration with the online 
video game Fortnite, trademarked blockchain-based digital sneakers called CryptoKicks, a virtual 
3-D  showroom  called  Nikeland  in  the  Roblox  environment,  trademark  applications  related  to 
the creation and sales of virtual sneakers and apparel, and the acquisition of RTFKT, a creative 
company that made digital sneakers and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) for the metaverse. 

Nike’s leadership team wanted to move aggressively into the metaverse, in keeping with the 
company’s reputation for pioneering design and innovative marketing. However, the leadership 
team  wanted  evidence  that  Nike’s  digital  team  was  placing  the  right  bets  at  the  right  time  in 
a  very  dynamic  and  confusing  space. To  prepare  his  digital  strategy,  Lavu  needed  to  assess  the 
experiments that Nike was participating in, evaluate trends in the evolution of the metaverse, and 
benchmark the strategic  moves of competitors such  as  Adidas.  It  was  time to  take  stock  of the 
various  experiments  that  Nike  had  conducted  between  2019  and  2021,  so  the  company  could 
chart  a  more  strategic  and  cohesive  path  forward.  Lavu  and  his  team  would  have  to  tread  the 
narrow path between being carried away by the hype and getting left behind by competitors in the 
brave new world of the metaverse.

The History of Nike: 1964 to 2019 

Nike  was  founded  by  University  of  Oregon  student  athlete  Phil  Knight  and  his  coach  Bill 
Bowerman at Eugene, Oregon, in 1964. Knight had met Bowerman when he ran for the university’s 
track and feld team. Bowerman was always tinkering with the athletes’ shoes, and Knight was one 
of the frst to try one of Bowerman’s alterations. Knight went on to Stanford for his MBA. After 
graduating from Stanford in 1962, he went on a trip to Japan, where he struck a deal with some 
Japanese businessmen to export their popular Tiger shoes to the United States. Knight reached out 
to Bowerman for support, and the two entered a 50-50 partnership deal with the Japanese for their 
new company, Blue Ribbon Sports. 

Knight started selling the Tiger athletic shoes out of his car and quickly realized they presented 
an attractive market opportunity as an alternative to the popular Adidas and Puma shoes of the 
time. In 1967, Knight and Bowerman came up with a new shoe design, called the Tiger Cortez, 
at once stylish and comfortable, that became an instant hit. Tis led to complications with Tiger 
in Japan; the two companies split in 1971. Tiger sued Blue Ribbon Sports, and a judge ruled that 
each company could sell its version of the shoes, which resulted in the shoes becoming a bestseller 
for  both  companies. Tiger  eventually  became  known  as  ASICS.  Blue  Ribbon  sports  rebranded 
itself as Nike, after the Greek goddess of victory. 

Nike  continued  its  success  story,  innovating  on  shoes,  including  the  “wafe”  sole  design, 
which resulted in the “Wafe Trainer.” Te company’s growth culminated in an IPO in 1980. Nike 
continued from strength to strength through the 1980s with the help of innovative advertising 
campaigns,  including  the  iconic  “Just  Do  It”  campaign  in  1988.  Nike  also  negotiated  path-
breaking celebrity endorsements. Te most famous was its tie-up with basketball legend Michael 
Jordan, and the launch of a shoe line called Air Jordans brought in revenues of $100 million by 
1985. Air Jordans continued to garner huge revenues for Nike as Jordan rose to superstardom. 

In 1990, the frst Niketown store opened in Portland, Oregon. Despite some bad press about 
low  wages  and  poor  conditions  in  Indonesian  Nike  factories,  Nike  signed  golfer Tiger  Woods 
in 1996 and basketball kings LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in 2003. Meanwhile, protests had 
broken out over the treatment of overseas workers, and Nike responded by raising the minimum 
employment age, increasing factory monitoring, and adopting USA-OSHA standards for clean air 
in overseas factories. In 2004, Nike acquired the shoe company Converse for $309 million. Tat 
same year, Knight stepped down as CEO and president, handing over the reins to William Perez. 

Nike continued to grow revenues and profts in the 2010s, becoming the ofcial supplier of 
NFL apparel in 2012 and of the NBA in 2018. In October 2019, Nike announced the appointment 
of John Donahoe as its next CEO. Donahoe had previously served as the CEO at eBay and the 
consulting frm Bain & Company. Under Donahoe, Nike continued to do well, a circumstance 
refected in an increase in its stock price rise from about $96 at the time he took over as CEO to 
about $166 at the end of December 2021, despite the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Nike Digital 

In 2017, Nike revealed its Consumer  Direct  Ofense  strategy,  aimed  at  connecting  directly 
with  consumers  via  direct  selling  and  digital  innovation.  In  2020,  the  pandemic  forced  the 
company to close 900 stores worldwide. However, the negative efect of store closures was more 
than compensated for by the growth in digital sales. In December 2020, Nike announced that it 
had recorded three consecutive quarters of 80 percent digital growth.1 As the pandemic continued 
worldwide, the company enjoyed double-digit growth in markets around the world: Europe, Asia-
Pacifc, Latin America, and China. It added 70 million digital members during the pandemic.2 
In 2018, Nike had announced a goal to achieve 30 percent digital penetration by 2023. Spurred 
on by the pandemic, it achieved this goal by June 2020 and raised its digital revenue goal to 50 
percent by 2022. 

In 2021, Nike’s Consumer Direct Acceleration aimed to increase digital sales with consumers, 
innovation,  and  investments  in  technology  to  enhance  digital  touchpoints.  To  that  end,  Nike 
acquired data platform Datalogue, to continue its quest for consumer-led digital transformation. 
Donahoe  said  that  it  “builds  on  our  digital  momentum  by  enhancing  our  ability  to  transform 
raw data into actionable insights in real-time and across the enterprise.”3  A trio of Nike apps— 
SNKRS, Nike Training Club, and Nike Run Club—drove tremendous value. Te SNKRS app 
had been downloaded nearly 500 million times globally. “Digital is now woven into everything we 
do as a company,” Donahoe said in an earnings call. “It’s how we operate and prioritize, from how 
we engage with members, to how we operate our supply chain, to how we serve consumers in the 
marketplace.…We are using digital to connect product to consumers like never before.”4 

Nike’s App Ecosystem 

Nike’s  e-commerce  app  was  the  main  platform  through  which  customers  purchased  Nike 
shoes and apparel. Nike saw more than 150 percent growth in mobile sales in 2021, powered by its 
commerce app. However, the company’s SNKRS, Training Club, and Run Club apps also played 
a key role in Nike’s digital strategy. 

Te SNKRS app ofered exclusive, highly desirable footwear to customers in the US, China, 
and Japan. In 2020, Nike reported $1 billion in revenue for the frst time from this app. Whereas 
SNKRS was designed for Nike shoppers, Training Club and Run Club were designed for Nike 
fans, an important distinction in the company’s eyes.  Users  could  plan  workouts  and runs and 
compete with friends to earn rewards through these two apps. In March 2020, in a bid to attract 
more  users,  Nike  dropped  the  premium  subscription  fee  for  the Training  Club  app.  Te  next 
month, Nike reported 20 million workouts on Training Club, a huge increase from 1.6 million per 
month in 2016. With the Training Club and Run Club apps, Nike focused on a direct connection 
and consistent digital engagement, which the company perceived as more valuable than the purely 
shopping  experience  on  SNKRS.  Trough  rewards  and  gamifcation,  the  user  was  continually 
invited into the world of Nike. Indeed, with these augmented experiences, the company hoped to 
blur the line between shopper and user. “Te key was to ofer services that naturally ft within the 
consumer’s daily activities,” said Matthew Boss, head of JPMorgan’s US retailing.5

The Metaverse 

Te term metaverse was coined by Neal Stephenson in his dystopian sci-f novel, “Snow Crash” 
(1992),  in  which  characters  used  digital  avatars  to  explore  a  fully  digital  world.  Te  metaverse 
allowed one to have a second life, or a second (digital) version of the physical life. Tis was possible 
by leveraging technology and using virtual reality and augmented reality headsets. In this universal 
virtual world, one could not only spend time interacting with friends and associates in a virtual 
space  but  also  play,  attend  concerts,  purchase  virtual  property,  and  shop  for  a  digital  avatar. 
Te metaverse promised a new generation of the internet, one that was based on activities and 
experiences, not just on information and content. (See this video introduction to the metaverse: 
vimeo.com/686463863.) 

Elements of the metaverse already existed in online video games such as Roblox and Fortnite. 
In these games, avatars interacted with others, playing, competing, and fghting for virtual money 
to adorn and decorate their virtual selves or virtual spaces. Many of the big technology companies, 
startups, and venture capitalist (VC) funds were signaling their interest in investing large amounts 
in the metaverse. Leading brands such as Nike were actively participating in the metaverse, as it 
promised to be the next-generation paradigm for digital customer engagement. 

Precedents of the Metaverse 

S e co nd  L i fe 

Te  metaverse  was  not  a  completely  new  development.  In  some  ways,  it  was  the  second 
coming of a 1999 social platform called Second Life. Created by Linden Lab, Second Life enabled 
people to use digital representations of themselves to socialize and connect with others and even 
to shop and build property to enhance their digital lives. (See this video for an introduction to the 
Second Life platform: vimeo.com/686467144.) Second Life was created long before Facebook was 
founded, and it predated even further the popular social networking platforms Instagram, TikTok, 
and Snapchat. However, compared to Facebook’s roughly 3.5 billion monthly users, Second Life 
had stagnated at about 1 million users since 2008. 

Later,  Second  Life  prepared  for  the  second  coming  of  itself  by  reimagining  the  social  and 
economic aspects of the game and giving users a better experience. At the end of 2021, Second Life 
had about 200,000 daily active users, compared with 43 million daily active users for Roblox, the 
biggest metaverse-like platform. Te Second Life economy reported a $600 million annual gross 
domestic product, with more than two billion user-generated assets. Te platform processed 345 
million transactions annually and paid about $80 million annually to creators. 

M ine cr af t  

Another  metaverse-like  platform  wherein  millions  of  users  immersed  themselves  for  hours 
every  day  was  Minecraft,  a  wildly  popular  gaming  platform  owned  by  Microsoft.  Minecraft 
sold  more  than  200  million  units  in  2020,  and  it  boasted  a  total  of  141  million  active  players

in  2021.  Minecraft  reported  between  2.8  million  and  3.6  million  daily  active  users  that  year. 
Like the newer metaverse platforms, Minecraft was decentralized, customizable, and immersive. 
Minecraft encouraged creativity by allowing users to build worlds and to participate in those they 
liked.  Minecraft  was  exceptionally  immersive  without  requiring  expensive  hardware  and  new 
digital media such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). However, like Second Life, 
Minecraft was glitch-flled and prone to hacking. 

Te experience of precedents of the metaverse, including Second Life and Minecraft, ofered 

some important lessons for the developers of metaverse platforms: 

•  A metaverse needed to provide an easy-to-use toolkit for users to be creative and to be able 

to express themselves. 

•  Very few creators would make enough money in a metaverse to earn a living by selling 

digital goods or NFTs. 

•  Ease of use, reliability, and security were crucial to attracting and retaining users. 

•  A metaverse was not likely to appeal to all demographics or to become a universal platform. 

Its initial appeal was expected to be to younger, gaming-centric audiences. 

•  Metaverse  platforms  inevitably  would  spawn  nefarious  activities,  such  as  fraud,  money 

laundering, sex trafcking, and intellectual property violations. 

•  To  avoid  becoming  obsolete,  a  metaverse  platform  needed  to  adapt  as  hardware  and 

networks evolve. 

Metaverse Platforms and Players 

Various platforms and players were jostling for mind share in the metaverse. Te watershed 
event  was  Facebook’s  announcement  (see  this  video:  vimeo.com/686467992),  on  October  28, 
2021, that it was changing its name to Meta and that it would spend $10 billion over the next year 
to build its metaverse. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, laid out an expansive vision that 
involved using new and improved AR and VR hardware to experience the metaverse. AR allowed 
users to embed virtual objects into the physical world, whereas VR used 3D computer modeling 
to let users immerse themselves into a 3D virtual environment. However, these headsets were still 
expensive, clunky, and uncomfortable. Although the metaverse did not require users to wear these 
headsets,  it  was  widely  believed  that  they  were  important  enablers  of  the  immersive  metaverse 
experience. 

F ace b o ok  H or izo n Wor ld s 

In  December  2021,  Facebook  took  a  step  toward  its  much-publicized  goal  of  “working 
and  playing”  in  the  metaverse  by  announcing  that  it  was  opening  Horizon  Worlds,  its  virtual 
reality world, to anyone 18 and older in the US and Canada. Previously, only Oculus VR users 
were  invited  to  join  the  virtual  world.  Facebook  had  acquired  Oculus  in  2014  for  $2  billion. 
In  Horizon  Worlds,  users  could  create  a  legless  avatar  to  traverse  the  animated  virtual  world.

Te Horizon Workroom app ofered virtual meeting rooms and video call integration for up to 
50  people  at  a  time.  Meta  CEO  Zuckerberg  wrote  that  he  anticipated  that  one  billion  people 
would  participate  in  the  metaverse,  spend  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  in  digital  commerce 
and create millions of jobs for creators and developers. However, critics called Horizon Worlds 
a “strange” experience that mimicked a virtual ofce more than a digital playground. TeGamer 
publication described Horizon Worlds as “less of a virtual utopia, and more of a glitchy, incomplete 
cluster of experiences.”6 

De ce n t r a l a nd  

Developed on the Ethereum blockchain, this was the most popular metaverse platform in 2021. 
Decentraland allowed users to purchase virtual land where they could monetize their assets and 
content. Decentraland had more than 90,000 parcels, which included individual parcels, estates 
(multiple parcels), districts (parcels with similar themes), and plazas (owned by the community). 
Decentraland ofered three types of tokens: MANA, the native currency; WEAR (for wearables and 
articles); and LAND (for owning a virtual plot of land). To attract others, Decentraland wanted to 
bring in creators, celebrities, and others to build content and advertisements and drop NFTs.* (See 
this  video  for  an  introduction  to  NFTs:  vimeo.com/686468088.)  Decentraland  was  backed  by 
more than 20 investors, including Digital Currency Group, Kenetic Capital, and Coin Fund, and 
had built partnerships with brands such as Samsung, Atari, Polygon, and even the South Korean 
government. 

T he  S a nd b ox 

Te Sandbox permitted users to tour virtual space, purchase virtual land, and interact with 
other  players.  Like  Decentraland,  Te  Sandbox  was  developed  on  the  Ethereum  blockchain. 
However, Te Sandbox had four types of tokens†: SAND (the native currency); ASSETS (content 
created  by  users);  GAMES  (created  by  users);  and  LAND  (the  virtual  land). Te  Sandbox  also 
had more than 166,000 plots of land that were grouped into estates (owned by one person) and 
districts  (owned  by  two  or  more  people).  Te  Sandbox  managers  had  a  clear  strategy  for  the 
future: to bring the platform to mobile devices before the end of 2022 and launch it on consoles 
such  as  PlayStation  and  Xbox.  Te  Sandbox  company  also  wanted  to  create  in-game  jobs  that 
would allow them to work as in the physical world. Te company was backed with a $93 million 
funding round by Softbank, one of the largest investors in the world. It had also partnered with 

*  NFT stands for non-fungible token, a unique unit of data stored on a blockchain, which was a form of digital 
ledger. NFTs could be owned and thus bought and sold. An NFT could be in the form of a photo, visual art, audio, 
video — even an in-game digital parcel of land. Unlike bitcoins, which were fungible and thus interchangeable, 
each NFT was unique and thus not interchangeable. 

†  Players  earned  SAND  tokens  for  completing  activities  in  the  world  so  they  could  buy  virtual  objects  in  the 
Metaverse. One SAND was equal to $6.55. Land made up Te Sandbox Metaverse, where players could purchase 
parcels and monetize them by hosting games or creating housing and other experiences. Assets, such as games 
designed on lands, could be sold or traded on Te Sandbox marketplace.

brands  such  as  Adidas,  Atari,  the  rapper  Snoop  Dog,  and  NFT  company  CryptoKitties.*  Te 
Sandbox, with more investors, partnerships, and a clear roadmap for the future, appeared to be 
gaining on Decentraland. 

Ro b lox 

Roblox was an online gaming platform that allowed users to play and program games created 
by other users. It was developed and released in 2006 by Roblox Corporation. Te video game 
platform emulated aspects of a social media network. For many years, the platform was relatively 
small, but its growth accelerated after 2015. Roblox was free to play, but in-game purchases were 
available through a virtual currency called Robux. By 2020, it had 164 million monthly active 
users; most of them in the US were younger than 16. Roblox users could create their own games 
with Roblox Studio; these games could then be played by other users. Roblox allowed users to buy, 
sell, and create virtual items to decorate their avatars. Te platform also occasionally hosted real-
life (e.g., birthday parties) and virtual events. Roblox was an older platform but considered one of 
the furthest ahead (along with Epic Games, creator of Fortnite) in building metaverses because it 
had already built a virtual world in which millions of people (mostly kids and teenagers) already 
socialized, spent digital money, and played digital games. See Exhibit 1 for a list of top metaverse 
platforms. 

Metaverse Use Cases and Applications 

Te  metaverse  promised  immersive  digital  experiences  for  consumers  in  domains  such  as 
gaming,  digital  commerce,  retail,  real  estate,  live  concerts,  sports,  and  learning.  Te  metaverse 
would also allow businesses to engage with customers, design new products, hold meetings, and 
train employees in an immersive environment. Although it was difcult to identify which use cases 
had the most potential and would attract early adopters, a few promising candidates had emerged: 

E - Co m me rce 

Shopping and commerce played a key role in the metaverse. People bought and sold things in 
a virtual world just as in the physical world. Anything from shoes to candles to food to clothes (all 
digital, of course) were sold in the metaverse. Creators and sellers could have an exclusive launch 
party,  and  people  anywhere  in  the  world  could  attend  in  the  digital  world;  users  could  have  a 
seamless  channel-to-channel  experience,  cardless  payments,  hyper-personalization,  among  other 
benefts. Te metaverse held the promise of merging physical and virtual experiences. For example, 
when  sneakers  were  sold  in  the  physical  space,  the  virtual  version  could  be  unlocked,  as  well. 
Conversely, a digital currency or NFT could be traded for physical goods. 

*  CryptoKitties  was  a  blockchain  game  on  Ethereum  that  allowed  users  to  purchase,  breed,  and  collect  virtual 
cats. Each cat was unique and could not be replicated or destroyed. Tis was one of the frst uses of blockchain 
technology for entertainment.

G a ming 

Games like Roblox and Fortnite already include many elements of the metaverse. Hundreds 
of  millions  played  these  games.  Games  created  billions  of  play  sessions.  People  had  the  ability 
to  engage  at  a  yet-unseen  level,  not  just  with  a  few  but  with  all  games  in  the  metaverse.  Te 
combination of technology, NFTs, e-commerce, and engagement resulted in increased virality and 
better monetization for games. Te metaverse would promote the growth of play-to-earn games, 
where people earned third-party revenue by playing games. Gaming was expected to disrupt the 
system, and gamers could even become crypto investors. It wasn’t just Big Tech that was interested 
in  gaming.  For  example, VR  startup  Aldin  Dynamics,  based  in  Iceland,  was  building  a  virtual 
world based on the game Waltz of the Wizards. 

Ed u c at io n / Le ar ning  

Te  metaverse’s  value  in  learning  was  to  provide  an  immersive  learning  experience.  Te 
possibilities  were  promising  because VR  and  AR  allowed  users  to  explore  and  experience  other 
worlds.  Virtual-  and  augmented-reality  solutions  allowed  users  to  receive  high-quality  and 
immersive content, not simply read about it. Students could use their avatars and VR headsets to 
experience museums, participate in shared environments, engage with instructors, and collaborate 
with  other  students.  Tree-dimensional  learning  content  promised  to  make  education  more 
engaging and satisfying. Several educational virtual experiences had already been created, such as 
Britain at War, Fossil Museum (an immersive exhibit), and Nautilus (about the Great Barrier Reef, 
which included a 180-degree viewing observatory). 

Re a l  E s t at e 

Using  cryptocurrency,  people  could  buy  and  sell  properties  in  the  virtual  world,  as  in  the 
real world. Even though real estate dealings in the metaverse were considered highly speculative, 
some  experts  believed  the  metaverse  would  expand  to  host  its  own  fully  functioning  economy. 
Digital  real  estate  was  already  selling  for  millions  of  dollars.  In  Decentraland,  a  plot  of  virtual 
land had sold for $2.4 million worth of crypto, and one sold for $4.2 million at Te Sandbox. 
Te popularity of digital land was spurring other companies to create digital worlds and digital 
properties. An example was SuperWorld, where a player could collect, buy, and sell plots of virtual 
land. It had unique plots valued at a total of $64 billion, including Mount Rushmore in the US, 
the Eifel Tower in France, and the Taj Mahal in India. 

Re t ail 

Te metaverse facilitated the creation of shopping venues such as e-stores and malls. However, 
the retail experience in the metaverse was much more than simply replicating the physical world. 
It  was  much  more  immersive,  designed  to  be  above  and  beyond  anything  ever  possible  in  the 
real world. Consider the experience of buying a car. Instead of simply buying from a showroom, 
people could take an immersive and adrenaline-fueled test drive in a racetrack of their choice in 
the metaverse and then have the car delivered in the real world. Similarly, the beauty experience

and marketers would need to rethink and reimagine what a “store” could be in the metaverse. Te 
goal was to create a hyper-personalized and immersive experience that far exceeded anything that 
existed in the physical world. Status symbols such as the virtual car, virtual jewelry, virtual houses, 
and other virtual belongings could become every bit as important and prestigious as they were in 
the physical world. Brands such as L’Oréal had already built a line of virtual cosmetics, and Gucci 
was already selling virtual clothing. 

E - S p or t s 

Te metaverse promised to revolutionize and lift fan engagement to an unprecedented level. 
In the virtual sports arena, fans would be able to create their own sports avatars, purchase sports 
equipment and souvenirs, socialize, co-watch events, party, train, work, and participate in gaming.7 
Sports in the metaverse was immersive and creative, with people joining leagues, interacting, buying 
products, taking photos and chatting with sports stars, and even meeting up in a virtual bar to 
socialize with other fans. Physical and geographical boundaries would melt away. Fans of American 
football, for example, could create sports avatars, sit with their friends and watch the sport (even 
though in the real world, these friends were many miles away), and socialize with other fans. Tey 
could watch from a variety of vantage points, zoom in on any play, and even run with the players 
on the virtual feld with multi-view camera technology. Fans could also purchase a seat in a virtual 
VIP box without the restrictions of availability that plagued the physical world. Tey could browse 
virtual  stores  for  physical  and  digital  oferings.  Organizations  such  as  the  International  Cricket 
Council were already partnering with advocates of the metaverse. 

Brands in the Metaverse 

Fashion brands quickly jumped on the metaverse trend and the burgeoning passion for the 
virtual  world.  Gucci,  Adidas,  Ralph  Lauren,  and  Balenciaga,  among  others,  quickly  realized 
the  potential  of  the  metaverse  and  the  promise  of  increased  engagement  and  immersion  from 
fans and customers. 

G u cc i  

Gucci started selling a virtual fashion collection on the platform ZEPETO. On the Roblox 
platform, Gucci launched a two-week version of Gucci Garden in December 2020. Players could 
choose  and  customize  their  avatars  and  purchase  exclusive  digital  items  from  Gucci.  A  Gucci 
Dionysus bag on Roblox sold for 350,000 Robux (roughly $4,115). In the real world, the same 
bag cost $3,450.8 Because it wasn’t an NFT, and Robux wasn’t a cryptocurrency, it was invalid 
outside of Roblox. What was notable was that the virtual bag sold for a higher price than that of a 
physical retail version.

In September 2021, shoe brand Vans created a skateboard-themed virtual world on Roblox. In 
“Vans World,” players could purchase skateboards and shoes, go skateboarding with friends, and 
win exclusive Vans gear. 

R a l p h L aure n  

For Christmas 2021, Ralph Lauren opened a virtual world called “Winter Escape” on Roblox 
where fans could visit the Polo store, skate with friends, and decorate the Christmas tree. Earlier 
that year, in August, the brand launched a 50-piece virtual clothing series partnering with ZEPETO 
and added attractions such as the Ralph Lauren cofee shop and the Ralph Lauren fagship store.

Te Spanish fashion brand decided to leverage the power of Fortnite and designed clothing 
for four characters in the game. Players could pay for the costumes using the Fortnite currency 
V-Bucks. Players who made these purchases could submit photos of their avatars for placement on 
the game’s town-square billboards. In the real world, people could shop the Balenciaga + Fortnite 
collection in the store’s New York location in Madison Square. 

J P M or g a n Ch a se Vir t u a l B a nk  B r a nc h 

Even  banks  were  getting  in  on  the  march  to  the  metaverse.  JP  Morgan  Chase  focused  on 
three  verticals:  enabling  game  platform  providers  with  bank-grade  products;  enabling  game 
and  content  creators  to  commercialize  their  oferings  easily;  and  scaling  the  metaverse  industry 
across multiple currencies and payment methods with custom solutions. Te company opened a 
virtual lounge in Decentraland to navigate issues such as account validation, transaction status, 
and fraud prevention. 

A r t i s t s  

In 2020, Fortnite held an in-game live concert with the rapper Travis Scott in a performance 
called  “Astronomical.”  Some  45.8  million  live  viewers  watched  a  200-foot-tall  version  of  Scott 
perform.9 Fortnite followed that with a metaverse performance by Ariana Grande. A giant avatar of 
Grande that even looked like one of the characters in Fortnite, with glowing white eyes, performed 
live. Donald Mustard, the chief creative ofcer of Epic, called it “an opportunity to almost create 
a  new  medium.”10  Another  well-known  rapper,  Lil  Nas,  performed  virtually  on  Roblox,  an 
experience that was visited nearly 37 million times. 

Risks and Challenges of the Metaverse 

Amid  the  frothy  enthusiasm  and  hype  surrounding  the  metaverse  and  NFTs,  several 
circumstances tempered the excitement, including the NFT ecosystem’s weak infrastructure and

sheer  number  of  scams,  hackers,  and  nefarious  developers  and  investors.  Even  though  “Web3” 
and “metaverse” supposedly had huge potential, these terms were still abstract, difcult to grasp 
for many people, and very much still evolving. Te promise of making millions had lured buyers 
into the NFT ecosystem, but many NFTs were spam or stolen works. For instance, on the popular 
NFT marketplace Open Sea, more than 80 percent of the NFTs were deemed to be plagiarized 
works  and  fake  collections.11  Tis  led  OpenSea  to  limit  the  number  of  times  users  could  mint 
NFTs for free. 

Similarly, digital art was another area where fraud and theft were so rampant that fraud alert 
systems had to be deployed. Another illegal activity was “wash trading,” in which an asset’s volume 
and value were artifcially infated by buying and selling to oneself or among an organized group. 
NFTs were also used to raise money for questionable projects in which anonymous founders simply 
took in millions of dollars and then disappeared with all the money. Te scale and volume of theft 
and fraud led many critics to call the NFT ecosystem broken. Unauthorized reproductions and 
trademark violations were increasing, and it was unclear how trademark law would be applied and 
held up in the digital world. Moreover, the defnition of the metaverse was not clear, and metaverse 
platforms had no interoperability, so brand sponsors could end up stranded in a metaverse platform 
that didn’t attract much trafc. 

Te  metaverse  also  presented  many  safety  problems  that  mirrored  those  in  the  real  world. 
Tese included unwanted contact, racial abuse, data privacy, and violent content. In the metaverse, 
an individual could get access to someone’s virtual space and get up close in a very intrusive way. 
Avatars could be hacked by cybercriminals who could access extremely sensitive and private data, 
and users could unwittingly end up interacting with these people instead of known and trusted 
friends. Especially troubling was a 77 percent rise in child “self-generated” sexual content from 
2019 to 2020, according to the Internet Watch Foundation.12 It was also risky that platforms were 
able to track and retain biometric information, as this gave them signifcant insights into a person’s 
real identity and thinking. Te rise of digital currencies likely meant a corresponding acceleration 
in the metaverse of harmful graphic, 3D, and auditory content. Regulators had yet to establish 
robust mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in metaverse platforms. 

Nike’s Forays into the Metaverse 

Te company had been making several moves to enter the metaverse. Stepping in seemed to 
be a natural next step for a brand with such enormous reach and fan following. Nike played its 
cards close to its chest but made clear that it wanted to protect its brands and trademarks for the 
new metaverse era. A look at Nike’s job listings confrmed its growing interest in the metaverse. 
Te company had posted positions such as “Virtual Material Designer, Footwear” on its digital 
product creation team. 

Nike had piloted several initiatives to explore the metaverse: 

1.  Fortnite/Nike  in-game  brand  integration.  In  2019,  Nike  launched  a  digital  sneaker  in 
partnership with Fortnite. Two new characters in the game were revealed to be wearing Nike 
shoes, called skins, from the Nike Jordan brand. Tese shoes came in various colors: red, black,

yellow, and purple. Fortnite, released in 2017, had roughly 250 million registered users. In 
2020, Fortnight creator Epic Games struck a deal with the National Football League to bring 
virtual  jerseys  to  Fortnite  (see  Exhibit  2).  Although  the  in-game  integration  would  create 
great exposure for Nike to Fortnite’s massive user base, it wasn’t clear if Nike would share in 
the revenues from the skins, which cost between $13 and $18 for a pair. In December 2021, 
Fortnite announced a continuation of its collaboration with the Jordan brand, focusing on the 
iconic sneaker Air Jordan XI ‘Cool Grey.’13 Fortnite invited players to participate in an online 
scavenger hunt and complete quests to earn rewards, such as the Playmaker (Blue) Style of the 
Hangtime Outft, the MVP (Silver) Style of the Hangtime Outft, and the Downtown (Silver) 
Style of the Swish Outft. 

2.  CryptoKicks:  blockchain-based  digital  sneakers.  Nike  developed  blockchain-compatible 
sneakers called CryptoKicks (see Exhibits 3 and 4). Te company established that a blockchain 
could be used to attach digital assets to a physical product, in this instance, shoes. Nike used 
blockchain to track the ownership and verify the authenticity of the shoes. Tose who bought 
a pair of CryptoKicks received a digital asset attached to the shoes’ unique identifer. When 
the shoes were sold to someone else, ownership was transferred by trading the digital shoes 
and any related digital assets stored in a “digital locker,” a cryptocurrency wallet-type app. In 
addition, if anyone on Nike had been playing CryptoKitties, as an owner of CryptoKicks, they 
would be able to breed the digital shoe with another digital shoe to create a “shoe ofspring”— 
an entirely new shoe design. 

3.  Nikeland on Roblox. Nike signed a deal with Roblox to capture a younger audience by creating 
a virtual world called Nikeland on Roblox’s online gaming platform. Participants could use 
Nike-branded shoes and apparel to dress up their avatars, check out product oferings, and 
try out new products. Nikeland was modeled after the company’s Oregon headquarters and 
featured Nike felds and arenas for players to participate in various mini-games such as Tag and 
Dodgeball and Te Floor Is Lava. Nike wanted to observe and test which products appealed to 
a younger audience. If kids showed a desire for certain Nike shoes and apparel, the company 
would produce those in the real world. Nikeland was free for the time being, and the company 
said it would work to update the virtual world with product and athlete integrations. 

4.  Trademarks  for  virtual  sneakers  and  apparel.  In  late  2021,  Nike  fled  to  protect  seven 
trademarks in the metaverse, signaling the company’s intention to make and sell virtual Nike 
sneakers and clothes. Tese included its name, the Nike swoosh logo, the “Just Do It” slogan, 
and the Air Jordan and “Jumpman” logos. Trademarks were a form of property that added value 
to the brand. Earlier, in April 2019, Nike had fled a trademark application for CryptoKicks, 
which Nike had planned to use as an NFT. 

5.  Acquisition  of  RTFKT,  a  virtual  shoe  company,  and  NFTs.  In  December  2021,  Nike 
announced  that  it  was  acquiring  RTFKT,  a  leading  brand  that  designed  digital  sneakers 
and next-generation collectibles that blended culture and gaming. Nike CEO Donahoe said 
that  it  provided  an  opportunity  “to  serve  athletes  and  creators  at  the  intersection  of  sport, 
creativity, gaming, and culture.”14  With this acquisition, Nike took another step in its digital 
transformation  and  extended  Nike’s  digital  footprint.  Founded  in  2020,  RTFKT  was  a 
pioneering  brand  created  to  serve  the  growing  community  of  digital  creators.  It  leveraged

the latest technology in NFTs, blockchain, and  augmented  reality  to  grow  its  brand  in  the 
metaverse by creating “one-of-a-kind virtual products and experiences.” 

Nike’s  digital  team  hoped  these  forays  into  the  metaverse  would  help  the  company  gain  a 
frst-hand understanding of the promise and the potential of the metaverse for its brand, customer 
relationships,  new  product  development,  and  new  revenue  streams.  Although  it  had  been 
important for Nike to be opportunistic and diverse in its experimentation with this new platform, 
the time had come to defne an integrated strategy and a cumulative logic for its initiatives that 
would improve its brand equity and drive revenue growth. 

Competition: Adidas Walks a Different Path 

In  contrast  to  Nike,  Adidas  embarked  on  a  community-frst  approach  that  focused  on 
partnerships with newer metaverse platforms and on the creation of NFTs. Adidas released a series 
of NFTs that gave owners access to special physical goods, such as hoodies, and to future digital 
experiences. Adidas collaborated with three partners: the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a highly sought-
after NFT collection; Punks Comic; and GMoney, a pseudonymous crypto enthusiast. A total of 
30,000 units of the NFTs, priced at about 0.2 ETH (about $800) on Ethereum, were mined on 
December 17, 2021. Tey sold out just a few hours after their release, netting almost $22 million 
in one day. Adidas also entered a partnership with the Bored Ape Yacht Club for a metaverse play 
by purchasing a Bored Ape NFT avatar. Adidas shared its look on Twitter, showing a Bored Ape 
avatar wearing Adidas-themed apparel. It celebrated the alliance with a trailer and called it “the 
time to enter limitless possibilities.” 

Te newer metaverse platforms were decentralized environments where users called the shots, 
in contrast to older platforms, such as Roblox and Fortnite, with which Nike had partnered (see 
Exhibit  5  for  a  network  comparison  between  Web2  and  Web3).  Te  older  platforms  featured 
centralized  control,  so  brands  could  carefully  curate  the  experiences  they  wanted  to  create.  For 
instance, Roblox’s proprietary platform was a “walled garden” because creators could only use tools 
ofered by Roblox to create content and make money. Web3 platforms such as Decentraland and 
Te Sandbox were decentralized. Tey were owned by users, so brands had to collaborate closely 
with communities of passionate creators and virtual landowners to engage with their audiences. 

Some experts felt that Adidas’s approach—of partnering with newer, decentralized platforms— 
was  bolder  than  Nike’s.  Adidas  dove  in  by  purchasing  a  Bored  Apes  Yacht  Club  NFT#8774 
in  September  2021.  Tis  collection  of  NFTs  was  one  of  the  best  known  with  celebrities;  well-
heeled owners included basketball star Steph Curry and talk-show host Jimmy Fallon. Adidas also 
purchased  land  in  Te  Sandbox  to  create  AdiVerse  to  rival  Nikeland  on  Roblox.  Players  could 
use the NFTs as virtual tokens to purchase virtual merchandise and dress up their avatars on Te 
Sandbox. Adidas’s bolder approach was also riskier because it involved investing in virtual land in 
the metaverse, creating a collection of expensive NFTs, and building a community over which it 
could not exercise centralized control.

Strategic Questions 

As  Nike’s  Lavu  reviewed  his  company’s  initiatives  and  Adidas’s  strategy,  he  organized  his 

thoughts into four categories of questions for the leadership team to address: 

1.  Prioritization: Nike would need to prioritize the initiatives based on the following: What did 
the company want to accomplish? What investments would it need? What had it learned so far? 
What risks were involved? And what advantage could it secure from the process? Lavu realized 
the need for a scorecard to evaluate and prioritize the initiatives. For instance, the Nikeland 
initiative was a potentially expensive investment, as it would need a dedicated software team. 
It was also somewhat risky because Nike was betting on Roblox, an older platform that did not 
ft into the futuristic vision of the metaverse. On the other hand, Nike’s in-game partnerships 
were less expensive and more agile, but the fnancial payof to Nike was unclear. 

2.  Evolution roadmap: Many of Nike’s initiatives were still nascent. Lavu would need to defne 
a roadmap for the evolution of each of the initiatives. For instance, what should be the next 
steps  for  the  CryptoKicks  and  CryptoKitties  project? What  about  the  RTFKT  acquisition? 
What new digital sneakers and other digital products should Nike create? Should it ofer NFTs 
for physical sneakers/apparel also, or just digital products? Also, how would the roadmaps for 
the  diferent  initiatives  intersect?  For  instance,  CryptoKicks,  RTFKT,  and  the  Fortnite  in-
game digital products seemed to have signifcant synergy. 

3.  Business outcomes: Te metaverse initiatives ultimately needed to drive business outcomes 
for  Nike.  Te  business  outcomes  could  be  broadly  categorized  into  two  areas:  brands  and 
relationships; and revenues and profts. Some of the initiatives would improve Nike’s brand 
equity,  strengthen  Nike’s  customer  relationships,  and  allow  it  to  reach  a  wider  audience. 
For  instance,  people  who  did  not  consider  themselves  runners  could  now  purchase  digital 
shoes and participate in digital games. Other initiatives (such as sales of NFTs and physical 
merchandise)  would  produce  revenues  and  profts  and  propel  Nike  toward  its  goal  of  50 
percent digital revenues by 2022. Lavu needed to ensure that each initiative had a clear link 
to a business goal and that the initiatives were relatively balanced between brand outcomes 
and revenue outcomes. 

4.  Competitive  stance:  Should  Nike  emulate  Adidas  and  bet  more  on  NFTs/decentralized 
metaverse platforms, or should it retain control and focus on “here and now” platforms like 
Roblox  and  Fortnite?  Should  Nike  open  virtual  environments  such  as  Nikeland  in  other 
metaverse platforms? Should it move away from Roblox, a good starting point but one built 
on legacy Web2 technology? Would Nike be comfortable with the decentralized governance 
model of the metaverse platforms, and would it be able to build relationships with communities 
of creators and virtual landowners to connect with its customers? In contrast to the openness 
envisioned by Web3 platforms such as Decentraland, where the metaverse was built and owned 
by creators, Facebook’s announcement revealed that, as a result of the company’s slow reaction 
to  digital  abuse  on  its  legacy  social  media  platform,  it  intended  to  defne  and  control  this 
future internet where the potential for harassment and transgressions could be even greater 
than  in  previous  iterations.  Given  Facebook’s  enormous  power  and  infuence  and  fnancial 
commitment to creating its version of the metaverse, should Nike align itself with Facebook’s

vision and plant its fag there? What should Nike’s approach be if such a single, controlled-by-
one-entity metaverse was possible? 

Nike had stuck several metaphorical toes in the water to learn and experiment in the brave 
new  world  of  the  metaverse.  But  the  company  now  needed  to  decide  how  to  dive  deeper  into 
a  space  that  seemed  promising—yet  also  risky.  On  the  one  hand,  the  metaverse  platforms  and 
NFTs were catching on like wildfre. On the other hand, no one could say defnitively what “the 
metaverse” would come to look like nor how participants would be able to move their assets and 
their identities across metaverse platforms. Te time for experimentation was coming to an end. 
Nike needed to defne a cohesive strategy to drive its brands and businesses forward.
