 Technology Innovation at Nike 

 A Case Preparation 
 by  Abhishek Bagalkot  , Managing Director,  Akrity 

 In March 2018, I hit a weight of 90 kilos at 5 foot 8 inches tall and 36 years old. A playful game 
 with the new weighing machine while my relatives were visiting, became a wake up call for me: I 
 wasn't as healthy as I thought! I never thought of myself as an athlete, but I always felt I was 
 “above average”. The reality of my overweight self, connected the dots for me on how climbing 
 stairs had become especially harder in the recent weeks and months. A fun activity with my 
 relatives forced me to think deeply about my weight and my health. In less than a week, I had 
 signed up with a coach to help me lose weight. 

 Soon I did what any techie would do as the first step to lose weight - buy a smart watch! 

 I searched the internet for the most suitable smart watches. Given I was already an iPhone user, 
 the Apple Watch was the first  flag of convenience  . I found out that the  Apple Watch Nike+  was 
 their top of the line watch product at that time. This was well before the days of  Apple Watch 
 Ultra  . But given it was the more expensive version for a newbie health enthusiast and a 
 consumer  technology laggard  like me, I settled for the other version and moved on. 

 The next decision was to pick an activity app to track workouts and runs. The free tier of  Strava 
 was an easy choice. My coach recommended it. Strava is a dedicated sports apps company that 
 caters to fitness enthusiasts to track fitness activities. With a stronger focus on running, cycling

 and hiking, they built a strong following among serious health enthusiasts and athletes. The app 
 gave me the choice to upgrade to a paid version later. After several weeks of using Strava, my 
 brother, who is an avid runner himself, suggested I use the  Nike Run Club App  instead. He said 
 he was using it, because it had running programs to develop aerobic capability and increase 
 running mileage. He was surprised I wasn't using it already. All his running friends used it. 

 Wait, what?! 

 Nike had a running app too? With running programs designed for newbie running just 
 developing the habit. As opposed to Starva that started you off with a free tier with more 
 advanced features unlocked after you upgrade to the paid version, the Nike Run App was free 
 forever. 

 It looked like Nike had several digital products. I simply wasn’t aware. The technologist in me 
 was intrigued. 

 That’s when I discovered Nike and Apple had announced  partnership since 2006  . By any 
 estimate they possibly started working together at least months if not years before. Just to be 
 clear, 2006 was one year BEFORE the launch of the first iPhone. Ten years later, they 
 strengthened the partnership by announcing  Apple Watch Nike+  . Turns out Nike had already 
 launched a digital activity tracker named  Nike Fuel Band in 2012  . A good four years before 
 Apple launched their watch! 

 The partnership made sense for Apple. Apple had just launched its first Apple Watch in 2015. 
 Fitness enthusiasts would be a natural fit for their market, given watches were able to track 
 movement and some health parameters. “But what’s in it for Nike?” I remember thinking. 

 Nike was not just following Apple into the digital fitness devices market revolution, they were 
 ahead of them! Everyone knows that  Apple is famously  late  to the market unless they feel they 
 have a product that they can bet on to dominate the category. But Nike was not a digital devices 
 manufacturer. It is a sports apparel company. An apparel retailer surging ahead of Apple into 
 fitness devices was quite a feat. 

 Nike was not behind in the fitness apps either: standing toe to toe with Starva, their closest 
 competitor in the category, in terms of popularity. Nike Run Club continues to be a very 
 successful fitness app. The table below shows the comparison in numbers.

 Nike’s Mobile App Ecosystem 

 Furthermore, Nike also has many more apps on the Appstore than Starva.  Nike Training Club  , is 
 an app for people training indoors and  Nike Studios  , lets book slots in one of many Nike 
 affiliated fitness studios.  Nike App  lets consumers make purchases directly from the digital 
 storefront without going to a retailer. 

 What amazes me is how an apparel retailer has become a fitness apps company, a devices 
 company, and a gym network to name a few. And dominate so many segments at once.

 has undertaken in the last decade or so.

 With such a wide variety of digital and technological company wide initiatives, Nike time and 
 again picks the right futuristic technologies to invest in. Not only that, Nike also continues to 
 succeed in adoption of emerging technologies and technological trends to strengthen its position 
 in the market. Therefore, it would surely be worthwhile to investigate what makes Nike 
 consistently successful in adopting new tech and driving organizational success through them. 
 The case in point and the links following provide sufficient context for researching and 
 understanding more about Nike's hugely successful track record.
