DBS: DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TO BEST BANK IN THE 
WORLD 

In 2014, Piyush Gupta, CEO and Director of DBS Group, along with his leadership team, set the goal 
for DBS to become the best bank in the world, ‘BBIW’, by 2020, by adopting a digital strategy. In 
2015,  the  Board  of  Directors  supported  the  new  strategy,  Strategy  2.0,  with  a  S$200-million 
(US$147-million) bet on DBS’ digital  transformation, demonstrating their faith in Piyush and his 
team. 

The bank achieved its goal two years ahead of schedule. In 2018, it won Global Finance’s Best Bank 
in the World award and Euromoney’s Best Digital Bank in the World (the latter was for the second 
time, after winning the inaugural award in 2016). Then in 2019, it became the first bank in the world 
to also be awarded the best bank in the world award concurrently from Euromoney, Global Finance 
and The Banker, as well as receiving several other accolades. 

The catalyst for DBS’ digital transformation was an outcome of the bank delivering results from its 
2014  five-year  strategy,  Strategy  1.0,  one  year  ahead  of  schedule,  and  also  the  rise  of  Fintech. 
Strategy 1.0 had put in place the foundation for the bank to adopt digitalisation. It had laid out an 
approach  for  DBS  to  become  ‘Asia’s  Bank  of  Choice  in  the  New  Asia’  by  streamlining  internal 
systems,  processes  and  performance  measurements,  and  reorienting  the  culture  towards  better 
decision-making and increased innovativeness and customer-centricity. 

Strategy  2.0  focused  on  ‘Making  Banking  Joyful’  by  leveraging  digitalisation  to  make  banking 
‘invisible’  for  the  customer.  It  was  launched  in  2015  and  implemented  around  three  strategic 
initiatives. The first was to be digital to the core, where most of the initial capital was invested. The 
second was to be customer-obsessed by leveraging customer journeys that focused on making DBS 
invisible to the customer; for example, via the online Marketplaces, customers would feel like they 
were buying a house, not the mortgage; or buying a car and not the auto loan. The third component 
was to create a start-up culture. This was the philosophy underlying DBS’ aim to become a ‘22,000-
person start-up’ (28,000 in 2019) by creating a culture of experimentation, innovation, and agile and 
calculated risk-taking in delivering positive changes and outcomes for the customer and the bank. 

By January 2020, it was apparent that the strategy had paid off, and DBS had been recognised as the 
best bank in the world. 

About DBS 

In 1968, DBS was founded as the Development Bank of Singapore. With a key objective of financing 
the economic development and industrialisation of Singapore, the performance of Singapore’s largest 
local bank mirrored that of the country. Its property division funded the construction of numerous 
buildings  in  Singapore’s  early  years,  such  as  the  Raffles  City  hotel-office-mall  complex,  Plaza

DBS: Digital Transformation 

Singapura mall, and several offices downtown. In 1998, DBS acquired another local bank, POSB, to 
have the largest retail banking presence in Singapore, as well as becoming Southeast Asia’s largest 
bank. 

As  a  key  growth  engine  of  the  country’s  financial  sector,  DBS  launched  many  firsts  in  banking 
products and services. It was responsible for the IPOs of stalwart Singaporean companies such as 
Singapore Airlines in 1985, and Singtel in 1993. In 2002, it listed the first REIT on the Singapore 
Exchange, introducing a new asset class to investors. In 2018, the bank celebrated its 50th anniversary 
by driving several new projects, which included mentoring and supporting 50 social enterprises across 
Asia. 

At the beginning of 2019, DBS had a presence in 18 markets across the globe. Its priority markets 
were its home market Singapore, as well as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, India and China. With 
more than 10 million retail customers and over 200,000 institutional customers, the bank recorded 
S$5.63 (US$4.131) billion in net profit and S$13.2 (US$9.68) billion in revenue for the year 2018. 

The Genesis of Digitalisation in DBS 

In 2014, recognising that changing trends in the strategic landscape were rapidly bringing the threat 
of Fintech to their doorstep, Piyush decided that DBS had to be faster and quicker than its competitors. 
He had several reasons to do so. 

First, he saw that Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba were making great strides not just in their 
home country, but also going abroad with solutions such as the Alipay payments app. He elaborated, 

When I compared notes with my counterparts in the  West, I realised that they weren’t half as 
paranoid  as  I  was  because  they  weren’t  seeing  what  I  was  seeing  every  day.  Sitting  here  in 
Singapore and seeing what they were being able to do in China scared the bejesus out of me. 

Second, DBS had emerged relatively unscathed in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. 
Piyush  reflected,  “We  were  in  a  position  of  strength,  where  the  bank  could  start  thinking  about 
tomorrow’s battles, not yesterday’s battles.” 

A third impetus for change was the failure to acquire Bank Danamon in Indonesia between 2012 and 
2013 due to regulatory changes. It became quite clear to Piyush that growing the bank inorganically 
was going to be challenging in the short- and medium-term given the difficult regulatory environment. 
But he also saw this as an opportunity to start doing things differently – and going digital became an 
attractive option in the course of pursuing growth. 

The fourth and final catalyst for Piyush was a personal one. His background was in technology; he 
had a personal disposition for and comfort with the domain. 

1  US$1 = S$1.36 as at 1 January 2019.

DBS: Digital Transformation 

Thus the seeds were planted for DBS’s digital transformation journey to begin, ahead of most other 
banks.  Piyush  reflected,  “I  think  when  you  put  all  of  those  [abovementioned  factors]  together, it 
would probably explain why we embraced this digital journey sooner than many other people did.” 

The leadership team launched the new digital transformation strategy ‘Making Banking Joyful’ in 
2015, and redesigned their one-page strategy image of a house (refer Exhibit 1) that had been used 
for Strategy 1.0 – which had become known as, “the house Piyush built”. 

Strategic Initiatives and the Digital Scorecard 

The direction and actions to take became clear as Making Banking Joyful and its Balanced Scorecard 
worked together as a guiding light. 20% of the Balanced Scorecard was allocated to Making Banking 
Joyful, 40% to traditional KPIs and 40% to strategic priorities (refer Exhibit 2 for further details). 
Commented Peter Seah, DBS Chairman, 

We share our balanced scorecard in our annual report and that tells everyone what our strategy 
is. But we believe it’s the execution, which is the whole organization coming together, embracing 
a new mindset, culture and direction, with everyone believing in it. 

The  leadership  team  worked  on  developing  the  new  digital  KPIs  to  track  and  measure  the 
implementation of the strategy, and created ATE; Acquire, Transact and Engage2. Piyush concluded, 
“You  manage  what  you measure.  And  because  we  started  measuring  it  in  a systematic  way, this 
forces people to continuously look at it and then build it into the business team’s way of working.” 

DBS Chief Financial Officer Chng Sok Hui elaborated, 

In the middle of the scorecard, we included metrics that pertained to the digital transformation, 
and we put a 15% weightage on that in the first year. In 2017, we increased that weightage to 
20% to reflect that digital value capture is increasingly important across the organisation (refer 
Exhibit 3 for the 2018 digital scorecard). 

To implement Making Banking Joyful, there were three key strategic initiatives, 1) Digital to the 
Core, 2) Embedding ourselves in the Customer Journey, and 3) Create a 22,000 Start-up. 

1. Digital to the Core 

In order to become truly digital, DBS needed to turn its core legacy systems inside out. This became 
the first component of the transformation strategy. Piyush explained, 

There  are  a  lot  of  people  who  would  still  argue  against  it,  that  it's  really  hard  for  legacy 
companies to change. But we are convinced that this is the best way to transform. It could well 
be that our Goldilocks size helps us make this  transformation in a way that larger companies 
might find more difficult. But certainly, we found it not only possible, but also really compelling 
and productive to attack the core, to go for broke. 

2  At a later stage, this became EATE as ‘E’ was added to measure ecosystems. This is discussed at greater length on Page 12 of the case 
study.

DBS: Digital Transformation 

Starting the Transformation of the Technology Core 

Although the digital transformation strategy was made official in 2015, the beginnings of technology 
transformation at the bank had already begun as early as 2010. Shortly after Piyush took over the 
helm of DBS as CEO that year, he challenged David Gledhill (Dave), then Chief Technology Officer, 
to look at overhauling and streamlining the bank’s technology backbone. 

When  Dave  joined the  bank  in 2008, initial  investment  had  already been made in revamping the 
technology  systems.  By  then,  the  bank  was  present  in  12  markets,  all  with  totally  different  core 
banking systems. It was already three years into a supposedly two-year technology transformation 
programme at its Singapore and Hong Kong operations. Dave assessed that this project was wildly 
over-ambitious as there were no clear goals and business case. He said, 

The budget was S$200 (US$147) million. They had already spent S$300 (US$220) million, and 
reckoned it was going to take another billion dollars to complete. I cancelled that whole project. 

This was a decision he had to defend to both Piyush and the Board, and later Piyush would comment 
that this initiative was an expensive lesson, but an important one that was a down payment on digital 
transformation. 

From 2015, Dave and his team focused on a few key questions to crystallise the agenda around the 
outcomes  to  be  achieved  from  digital  transformation.  They  asked  some  key  questions:  What  did 
being world-class in digital look like? How could the bank innovate with technology? What changes 
were needed to get the business moving? To answer these questions, they visited several technology 
companies.  To  think  like  a  technology  company  and  not  always  as  a  bank,  Dave  created  a  new 
question, “What would Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos do?” In fact, the question, “What would Jeff do”, 
caught on across the bank to transform people’s approach. Dave’s technology visits also gave birth 
to a term, GANDALF, which became very popular to explain the bank’s digitalisation. 

GANDALF 

Let’s be the D in GANDALF.

David Gledhill, former CTO, DBS 

DBS started to explore the best practices they could adopt from the technology world, so that it would 
be perceived as not only a bank, but also a platform company and technology integrator. 

The first letters of Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, LinkedIn, and Facebook together spelt GANALF, 
and Dave, a fan of the classic fantasy novel Lord of the Rings, coined the acronym ‘GANDALF’ 
(which also happened to be the name of a wizard in the book), setting a goal for DBS to be the ‘D’ 
in the company of global technology giants. The plan was for DBS to use open-source software like 
Google,  run  on  cloud  platforms  as  did  Amazon,  use  data  and  automation  to  scale  and  provide 
personalised  recommendations  like  Netflix,  design  like  Apple,  be  a  learning  community  like 
LinkedIn  and  push  for  continuous  learning,  and  become  more  collective  like  Facebook.  Dave 
explained the mindset shift that was needed,

DBS: Digital Transformation 

We said to our people, ‘Don't compare yourself to other banks. Compare yourself to technology 
companies  because that’s now the benchmark we’re operating  against.’  And  it had  this great 
cultural  effect  of  setting  people  free  - to  be  bold  enough  to  really  drive  change  and  not  be 
constrained by the way banks normally do things. 

Implementing GANDALF 

But merely having a sticker saying GANDALF was not going to get the undertaking very far. Having 
studied the tech giants and their practices, Dave and his team came up with five key pillars that would 
support how the bank changed the way it operated and drive digital transformation throughout its 
core systems and processes: 1) shift from ‘project’ to ‘platform’; 2) organise for success; 3) develop 
high  performing  agile  teams;  4)  automate  everything;  and,  5)  design  for  modern  systems  (refer 
Exhibit 4). 

The team  stipulated goals and  set  targets for  each of  the  five  pillars  so that  they  could track and 
measure performance, and then drove the adoption across DBS’ business teams and platforms. 

Simultaneously  the  bank  also  attacked  the  levels  of  bureaucracy  and  moved  away  from  steering 
committees  which  required  multiple  approvals  at  every  stage.  In  2015,  there  were  198  ongoing 
projects for the consumer bank division alone and the technology team needed to improve its cadence. 
There was a shift from what Dave called ‘control to context’. He elaborated, 

Let’s say you’re in charge of this set of platforms, say, the wealth management platforms. We're 
going  to  give  you  some  funding,  and  with  that,  you  are  to  deliver  the  following  outcomes: 
customer growth, deeper penetration, new product services, whatever it is. You go figure out how 
you're going to spend it  to achieve these business outcomes. We’re not going to  control every 
dollar you spend through committees and approvals. Just go for it. 

Teams were also reorganised for success. The shift to platform thinking meant establishing platform 
teams to deliver the desired outcomes. Previously, business and technology would have separate and 
potentially opposing goals, for instance, business had a revenue goal while technology would have a 
resiliency (stability) goal. With the reorganisation, both sides would work together as one team with 
shared goals and KPIs. The mantra, “business equals technology; technology equals business”, was 
adopted, with both functions complementing each other to represent what Dave called DBS’ ‘digital 
DNA’. To reinforce the mantra, “Two in a Box” was adopted, and was where the tech and business 
head collaborated to understand each other’s business. The idea was that each head learnt the other’s 
responsibilities, and was in a position to switch roles when required. 

New  principles  such  as  DevOps  were  introduced,  so  that  teams  could  formulate  nimble  and 
appropriate  responses to incremental  feedback for  new  products.  This  was  paired  with the fourth 
pillar, automation, so that new product rollouts or improvements could be  tested and deployed to 
market with minimal manual work and time to market, resulting in the maximum amount of rapid 
learning from customer feedback. Dave observed, 

Automated testing has dramatically increased–we're now almost 100% automatically deployed. 

And lastly, designing for modern systems necessitated making changes to the very core of the bank’s 
existing systems and processes. To do this, Dave and his team did two very crucial things.

DBS: Digital Transformation 

The first was insourcing. DBS had historically outsourced most of its technology services to third-
party vendors. Dave quipped, 

When I arrived at DBS, we were outsourcing 85% of our technology services. We had a bunch of 
technology  people  signing  contracts  and  managing  members;  we  were  doing  contract 
management, not building technology. 

Dave’s objective was for the bank to develop strong technical skills of its own, and it started hiring 
technology people. By the end of 2018, DBS’s technology was 90% self-managed. The bank was 
effectively running like a tech company, and was able to build, design, run and operate all of its own 
technology. 

The second key thing that the bank did was to move its capabilities to the cloud. Dave explained, 

It’s not about applying cloud lipstick but being cloud to the core. If you only move some of it, you 
can achieve maybe 20% in operational savings. Moving everything is a lot harder to do, but it 
can get you up to 80% cost improvement if you  migrate from various legacy systems to  cloud 
native3  infrastructure. 

With the move to the cloud, the bank managed to consolidate and shrink its  physical  data server 
footprint by 75%, while still allowing for a 10x excess capacity to scale. 

Not everything went smoothly. For example, in 2014, DBS partnered with IBM to deploy IBM’s 
Watson cognitive computing innovation to enhance the customer experience. It was initially adopted 
into wealth management. A couple of years later DBS terminated the IBM Watson partnership as the 
computing power was more than they required. In 2017, DBS and IBM worked together again on 
adopting Robotic Process Automation, making it the first-of-its-kind large-scale implementation in 
the financial services sector in Singapore and the region. 

Over  time,  the  nature  of  the  technology  work  being  done  had  moved  on  from  fixing  the  basics, 
towards creating competitive advantage. Dave recounted, “Now, most of our effort spent is invested 
in customer experience and digitalisation.” 

2. Embed Ourselves in the Customer Journey

banking errand.

In May 2018, the bank changed its ten-year old tagline of “Living, Breathing Asia” to “Live More, 
Bank Less”. This tagline for  Strategy 2.0 initially created confusion, as staff  wondered why they

DBS: Digital Transformation 

it easier for customers to conduct their banking by leveraging digital. The new strategy was well 
received and rapidly adopted across the whole bank. 

At the same time, the internal mission was clearly defined as ‘Making Banking Joyful’ for customers 
and employees alike. Piyush elaborated, 

We spent a lot of time trying to think about what the soul of DBS should be, and what our role is 
in the context of society at large. Banking or financial services is actually a very meaningful part 
of life. We realised that the basic problem is that most people have started distrusting banks, and 
most people think that banking is a pain. The question was how do you take financial services, 
make  it really simple,  fun  and  meaningful to  the  customer  to  help them  improve  their  lives in 
whatever way they wanted? That's the idea of ‘Making Banking Joyful’. 

One way to make banking joyful for the customer was to make it ‘invisible’, so that they could ‘Live 
More, Bank Less’. To do this, DBS turned to mapping out the customer experience through ‘customer 
journeys’, as well as using data analytics. 

A significant question a leadership team needed to answer was, “What does digitalisation mean to 
their employees?” 

Continuing Focus on Customer Journeys 

Paul  Cobban,  who  had  joined  the  bank  in  2009  and  assumed  the  role  of  its  Chief  Data  and 
Transformation Officer in 2017, had introduced customer journey thinking as a path for the bank to 
carry out its processes under Strategy 1.0. This meant empathising with the customer by identifying 
the  “job  to  be  done”4  and  thinking  of  the  ‘journey’  they  took  to  carry  out  daily  tasks,  including 
banking. Closely related to that was the idea that customers did not do banking for banking’s sake, 
but to fulfil an ultimate purpose. 

At  the  bank’s  annual  strategy  planning  off-site  in  2015,  Piyush  and  his  250-strong  senior 
management team officially kicked off the bank’s digital transformation journey. Out of the two days 
allocated for the off-site, an entire day and a half was spent training the senior managers on customer 
journey thinking, so that they were equipped to run customer journeys for their own teams. Each 
leader had to adopt a customer journey, and was allocated five minutes to present on the projects 
they were planning to roll out in the coming year to increase the digitalisation of their business lines— 
something that was made part of their KPI for the year. 250 customer journeys were targeted that 
year, and Piyush personally reviewed the progress. 

By 2018, DBS was running a total of 600 end-to-end customer journey processes tied to Strategy 2.0, 
with the goal of promoting digital means of transaction processing, acquisition or engagement with 
the customer. Effectively, the bank would, through these customer journeys, embed itself seamlessly 
into customers’ daily routines, accompanying them and facilitating their goals at every stage of their 
life.

DBS: Digital Transformation 

The use of data analytics was necessary for the bank to stay close to the customers, anticipate their 
needs, and offer them recommendations that were relevant to them. Sameer Gupta, Chief Analytics 
Officer, DBS (a role created in mid-2017), explained the bank’s objective in using data analytics, 

People are obsessed with Big Data. We said Big Data’s not important; Big Analytics is important. 

Piyush  explained  why  having  good  data  analytics  made  all  the  difference  when  engaging  with 
customers, 

In banking, as the cost of customer acquisition is very high, it is a typical practice to try to cross-
sell new products to the customers. So one of the big holy grails is the ability to cross-sell. But 
that is merely product pushing… how do you shift from cross-sell to cross-buy? Data lets you do 
that.  If  you  have  good  user  data  and  you  understand  the  context  in  which  the  customer  is 
operating, then you can come up with recommendations that would encourage the customer to 
cross-buy instead. 

To manage the potential questions and issues surrounding data appropriateness, privacy and security 
that  would  come  up  with  using  the  findings  from  data  analytics,  the  bank  formed  the  ‘PURE’ 
committee on decision-making surrounding how to use customer data. PURE stood for data that from 
a customer’s perspective was applied in a way that was ‘Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful and 
Explainable’. Internally, data access was granted to the extent that it corresponded to the roles that 
people had vis-à-vis the customer. 

Data First Culture 

To create a data first culture, it was necessary to change the mindset of employees, the way people 
worked and the way employees thought about making improvements. To achieve this outcome, DBS 
targeted four essential components: 

1.  Culture: How could the company embed a data first culture in which employees leverage 
data  to  enrich  their  decision  making?  This  included,  for  example,  eliminating  decision-
making based on who talks loudest in a meeting. 

2.  Capability: How can capability be created across the bank? 
3.  Enabling: Traditionally data was locked down and released on request. Moreover, given the 
risks  involved,  data  needs  to  be  protected. The  challenge  was  to  make  data  discoverable 
(safely) and usable (reliability). 

4.  Tooling: How to develop infrastructure for the future, such as AI, machine learning, GPU 

(Graphical Process Units), with secure data warehouse? 

The bank also started hiring data scientists and reskilling business analysts to learn the tools to work 
with data more effectively. Dave described the types of people that helped to bring about the data-
driven culture, 

We have hardcore data scientists, who in many cases we hired. Then there’s a whole community 
of data translators, who are mostly existing staff. They’re people who understand the business 
and business analytics, who can be a bridge between the data modelling and everything else.

DBS: Digital Transformation 

There were some early successes, such as engaging with HR to predict when a salesperson would 
leave the bank, and being able to predict customer calls to the call centre. 

Dashboards 

The other initiative that DBS took to embrace a data-first and digital mindset was to do away with 
the use of slide decks and instead employ dashboards for reporting. Items from the scorecards were 
linked to the respective business and department dashboards, so that they could be constantly tracked. 
The dashboards served two purposes: they enabled data visualisation so that users could clearly see 
if the transformation was on track, and they also allowed the data to be drilled down to the product 
level, customer level or even individual transaction level. This practice enabled the business teams 
to make meaningful decisions. 

Benefits of Increasing the Use of Digital Channels 

Very  early  on  in  the  digital  transformation  process,  DBS  had  hypothesised  that  digitally  active 
customers would see much better outcomes in terms of incomes, revenue expense ratios and return 
on  equity  than  customers  who  were  not  digitally  active.  The  bank  termed  this  positive  outcome 
‘digital value capture’. DBS then began to track these two groups of customers, and the activities 
they undertook separately. 

Over three years from 2015 to 2017 in the Consumer and SME (Singapore and HK) segment, it found 
that the total engagement of digitally active customers was  manifold times higher than traditional 
customers, through activities such as account balance checking and making payments. In Consumer 
Banking, the multiple  was  16  times,  while in  SME, the  multiple  was  six  times. The  revenue  per 
digital customer was double the revenue of a traditional customer on account of an increased uptake 
of  products,  higher  loan  and  deposit  balances,  as  well  as  higher  credit  card  and investment 
transactions. There were also substantial cost savings from servicing a digitally active customer who 
did not need a relationship manager or paper forms to transact. Sok Hui commented, 

The cost to income ratio is a lot lower - 34% for a digital customer versus 54% for a traditional 
customer [in 2018]. The return on equity of this digital segment was 32%, ten percentage points 
higher than for the traditional customer. In 2018, 48% of our customers were digital. They gave 
us 68% of the revenue pie and 76% of the profit pie. 

Digital Transaction 

One of the key activities along the journey of becoming a digital bank was converting traditional 
customers to digital  customers, and convincing them to transact  with the bank through its digital 
channels. Sok Hui explained, 

We came up with three criteria to separate digital from traditional customers. A customer was 
digital if in the last 12 months, i) he had bought a product online, ii) he had done more than 50% 
of  his  financial  transactions  online,  or  iii)  he  had  done  more  than  50%  of  his  non-financial 
transactions (e.g., address update) online.

DBS: Digital Transformation 

The criteria were first applied to retail and SME (Small Medium Enterprise) customers in Singapore 
and Hong Kong, which made up 44% of the bank’s overall revenue mix. Digital customers were re-
qualified on a rolling 12-month basis. To maintain their digital status, customers would from time to 
time be incentivised to use DBS’s digital services, such as being rewarded with a cash voucher if 
they signed up for a new digital service. 

Digital Engagement 

To  better  engage  customers  digitally,  the  bank  improved  the  user  experience  for  its  retail  and 
institutional digital platforms. For instance, in 2016, Sparks, a mini-series about the lives of young 
bankers,  was  created  in-house  by  DBS’  Strategic  Marketing  and  Communications  team.  It  was 
watched by more than 250 million viewers by 2018, and played a part in triggering about 10% of the 
customer inquiries that the bank received. 

In  May  2014,  the  bank  introduced  ‘DBS  PayLah!’,  a  mobile  wallet  app  that  made  peer-to-peer 
payments possible just by knowing the recipient’s mobile phone number.5  This enabled the making 
of  cashless  payments  to  individuals  and  small  businesses  alike.  In  December  2018,  DBS  further 
enhanced this capability by adding QR code scanning capabilities for payment to recipients.6 

Gene Wong, Head of Ecosystems, Consumer Banking Group, DBS, added, 

DBS was the incumbent in Singapore and dominated the consumer banking space. PayLah! was 
a fundamental piece of the puzzle for setting the agenda for cashless payments and could be the 
main consumer app for all the customer’s lifestyle needs, such as movie tickets, transport and 
dining. We thought, ‘This is our game to lose’. 

In  February  2017,  DBS  rolled  out  iWealth,  an  app  for  its  priority  and  private  banking  clients. 7 
iWealth would enable clients to access their investment portfolios at a glance and customise reporting 
according  to  their  preferences,  such  as  by  asset  type  or  currency.  In  2018,  the  Wealth  business 
division’s income grew by 26%. The same year, it also launched the POSB Smart Buddy Programme, 
whereby parents could use a smartwatch to teach their children how to make digital payments, save 
money, and also track their eating and spending habits.8 

In  October  2017,  DBS  introduced  the  Treasury  Prism,  the  world’s  first  online  treasury  and  cash 
management  simulation  tool  for  institutional  customers.  The  tool  addressed  the main  pain  points 
faced  by  companies  trying  to  arrive  at  their  ideal  cash  management  solution.  Not  only  did  the 
Treasury Prism provide the benefits and costs of different cash management structures, but it also 
took into account the relevant regulations and tax considerations that would apply in each country.

DBS: Digital Transformation 

On  26  April  2016,  DBS  launched  digibank  India,  the  first  mobile-only  bank  in India.9  Digibank 
demonstrated internally the potential of digitalisation, helping to build confidence and momentum in 
Making Banking Joyful. It was a clear example of how being digital to the core enabled the bank to 
penetrate new markets by offering unprecedented, innovative products  with no physical presence. 
Digibank evolved from the bank’s first hackathon and targeted to ‘design for no ops’. In fact, this 
was not about designing completely for no operations – but more about eliminating the unnecessary 
components and focusing on the value add, which was delighting customers. Data analytics was used 
to reflect performance. 

One of the initial challenges for the team was ensuring compliance with the banking regulation ‘KYC’ 
(Know Your Customer). This typically required a customer to visit a branch to confirm identification, 
and was a difficult proposition when there was no physical presence in the country. However, the 
API10  ecosystem that the bank was developing provided a solution by allowing it to partner with 
Café Coffee Day, a local coffee chain with about 600 outlets throughout  India. A customer could 
walk into the store and open a savings account within minutes. The customers would present their 
national  identification  Aadhar11  card  to the  barista,  place their  thumb on  a point of  sale terminal 
provided  by  DBS  that  was linked  to the  government’s  identity  system  for  their thumbprint  to  be 
biometrically validated, and open a bank account. 

In addition, the bank went paperless for transactions and favoured digital payment instructions over 
paper, although India was largely a cheque-based society. The customer journey was made easier by 
enabling the payment instruction to be sent in just two or three clicks of a button. Customer service 
was done through artificial intelligence (AI) virtual assistants or chatbots that were trained to answer 
the most common questions. Karen Ngui, Managing Director and Head of Group Strategic Marketing 
and Communications, described digibank as “branchless, paperless, and signatureless”. 

Sok Hui observed the healthy uptake of the mobile banking service, “In India, as of beginning 2019, 
we have over 2.2 million customers. That would not have been possible so soon if we were using a 
brick-and-mortar strategy.” (refer to Exhibit 5 for more details on digibank India). 

In November 2018, DBS launched digibank Indonesia, announcing local ride-hailing service GO-
JEK as its ecosystem partner. 

Digital Ecosystems 

In November 2017, DBS launched the world’s largest banking API platform. The platform went live 
with more than 200 APIs and more than 80 DBS partners, ranging from Fintech start-ups to telcos. 
The use of APIs enabled the bank to integrate external partners seamlessly into its digital ecosystem, 
to create new customer applications and scale its range of new product and service offerings easily. 
In 2018, DBS launched different Marketplaces for cars, property, and electricity, providing a reliable 
source of such listings to its customers.12. As at August 2019, DBS had over 450 APIs.

DBS: Digital Transformation 

In January 2019, DBS published a research paper titled “Pivot or Perish: Ecosystem, the emerging 
business model”.13  It defined an ecosystem as “Bringing together entities in disparate industries to 
create new offerings or capture value that individual companies or sectors may not be capable of 
creating on their own. Through ecosystems, marketers gain the ability to cater to customer needs, 
without prompting the customer to look further than the company for a product.” 

Gene  explained  how  partnerships  were  a  crucial  part  of  welcoming  customers  into  the  DBS 
ecosystem, 

Customer engagements are happening out there in real life. We would be burying our heads in 
the sand if we don’t recognise that it might take the customer 20 clicks on other websites before 
they  reach  the  DBS  portal  to  transact.  We  have  to  partner with  whomever  the  customer  is  in 
contact with to acquire new customers. Furthermore, using non-traditional data for underwriting 
is not possible without partnerships with third-parties such as telcos and ride-hailing platforms 
that are in direct contact with the customer. 

Sok Hui explained how the bank’s risk management framework expanded in sync to encompass the 
broader ecosystem, 

We  made  sure  that  as  we  grow  in  this  area  and  our  APIs  get  connected  to  more  and  more 
ecosystem partners, the risk management aspects are also taken care of.  We have a process to 
know how data is transferred, and whether there are cybersecurity risks, etc. 

At DBS, ecosystems were developed leveraging APIs by participating/investing where the customer 
was, and then orchestrating to build into the customer lifestyle. 

A New Scorecard Measure 

Within  the  overall  digital  transformation,  the  bank  measured  four  main  activities  that  it  believed 
would  bring  about  positive  results  from  being  digital  with  the  customer,  something  that  was 
abbreviated  initially  as  Acquire,  Transact,  Engage  and  later  evolved  to  ‘EATE’  as  Ecosystems 
became a critical area to measure and manage the business. 

3. The 22,000-Person Start-up 

In 2014, to make a company of then 22,000 people operate more like a start-up needed some planning 
and changes. Paul introduced ‘Culture by Design’ to identify the new desired culture, and what had 
to be done to transform the culture. The acronym ABCDE made explicit the characteristics of the 
start-up culture:14

DBS: Digital Transformation 

Customer-obsessed: understand customers’ pain points 
Data-driven: use data holistically to transform internal processes 
Experiment and take risks: encourage the 4D process of discover, define, develop and deliver. 

In  order  to  help  employees  to  more  easily  adopt  the  start-up  culture,  the  bank  ran  a  series  of 
programmes to acquaint employees at all levels with the practices of innovation and experimentation. 
Paul explained the rationale behind the programmes that were rolled out, 

I’m not a data guy; I’m a culture change guy.  And culture change is more about behavioural 
change  rather  than  capability  or  technology.  In  order  to  get  the  best  performance  and  most 
traction, we had to build creative confidence, provide stable leadership and strategy, and ask 
people to put the ‘t’ in transformation by setting the bar very low for them to be able to participate. 

Daring to Experiment (and Fail) 

From 2015, to eliminate the fear that people had  of  experimentation and taking risks, hackathons 
were organised where employees would join with external coders and entrepreneurs (from start-ups) 
to form a team of about ten people, for a three-day design session, which was proceeded by two-days 
of education and problem identification. 

On the first day of early Hackathons, the bankers were taught the methodologies to apply, such as 
how to carry out customer journey thinking and conduct fact-finding interviews (refer to Exhibit 6 
for  more  details  on  the  4D  design  process  to  understanding  customer  pain  points  and  to  create 
solutions that addressed these pain points). The second day, they would be given a problem to solve. 
Thereafter, the team had 72 hours to solve the problem through customer interviews, focus groups 
and storyboarding. The objective was to create an app which the team had to showcase on the fifth 
and last day. 

To give recognition to people who aimed to innovate, the bank even created a ‘Dare to Fail award’ 
for those who tried something new and failed, thus giving the signal that it was okay to do so. Early 
successes were given positive recognition and mentioned at town hall meetings. Piyush personally 
reviewed each of the new projects or programmes the bank was undertaking every few months. 

The third hackathon the bank conducted had the criterion that only bankers over the age of 40 years 
old could participate. This was initiated by Piyush, after watching his 85 year old father shopping 
and submitting his taxes online. Piyush wanted to quickly squash the notion that digitalisation was 
only for younger bankers, and create the belief that age was not was a controlling factor. The over-
40s hackathon achieved this. 

By 2018, around 15,000 employees had been involved in at least one innovation project. 

Paul also shared the importance of removing obstacles, or ‘blockers’ to changing culture, 

The  number  one  blocker,  as  identified  by  our  leaders,  was  meetings  –  too  many  meetings, 
ineffective  meetings,  and  people  not  understanding  what  they’re  doing  at  the  meeting.  So  we 
experimented by creating a ritual, and ended up with ‘Meeting MoJo’. Where implemented, it 
doubled the effectiveness of meetings. ‘Mo’ is the meeting owner and he has to do three things. 
First, begin the meeting stating the purpose and context of the meeting. Second, at the end of the

meeting, Mo has to summarise what was discussed during the meeting. Third and most important 
of all is that Mo has to ensure that everybody in the meeting has an equal share of voice. And we 
also appointed a ‘Jo’, which stands for ‘joyful observer’, who at the end of the meeting says how 
well Mo did the job. An unexpected positive side effect is that Jo practises giving feedback, which 
is a skill we often don’t use enough at work. 

Digital Bankers 

In 2017, HR introduced DigiFY, a mobile and online platform aimed at providing fundamental digital 
training to DBS’s bankers to transform them into ‘digital bankers’.15  After completing the training 
in the seven areas of agility, data-driven mindset, digital business models, digital communications, 
digital technologies, journey thinking, and risk and controls, bankers would be certified and equipped 
to pass on the knowledge to their colleagues.16 

Digital transformation took place throughout the bank, not only in the business functions, technology 
and operations, but the corporate functions as well (refer Exhibit 7 for further details on the digital 
transformation initiatives in Audit). 

Different methods were implemented to support employee’s transformation as the bank became a 
learning organisation, such as eliminating approval for any skills training course less than S$500. 
“iTQ” (I Thank You) was launched in 2017, an online peer-to-peer recognition program that made 
saying thank you to anyone across the bank (and across geographies) straightforward. Leaders had a 
reverse mentor to provide opportunities to learn areas of the business in a one-on-one meeting with 
an employee. This also allowed them to probe and ask questions that they may not ask in meetings 
or other situations. 

In June 2018, Human Resources adopted the use of AI for recruitment—Southeast Asia’s first virtual 
bank recruiter, “Jim” (short for Jobs Intelligence Maestro), was born as a result of the collaboration 
between  the  talent  acquisition  team  and  an  AI  start-up.  The  custom-made  system  benefitted  the 
recruitment team by automating the pre-screening process, saving man-hours, and enabling recruiters 
to focus on candidate sourcing and interviews. Jim’s round-the-clock availability enabled real-time 
interaction  with  job  applicants  and  the  administering  of  psychometric  assessments  at  any  time 
without coordination with HR. Jim was first deployed in the bank’s core markets and for high-volume 
roles  such  as  management  associate  positions,  for  which,  out  of  7,000  applicants,  only  20  were 
selected. Piyush attested to the effectiveness of Jim, “It allowed us to bring our turnover rates down. 
We're hiring better people who are more suited to the job.” 

What Next? 

From 2014, DBS’ digital transformation had entailed overhauling the bank’s legacy systems from 
the core, doubling down on its customer-centric approach to further embed itself into the customer 
journey, and cultivating a start-up culture by design. Piyush commented,

DBS: Digital Transformation 

I think a lot of people would say that being able to put a Singapore bank on the world map is a 
reasonably good achievement. To have the world's best bank come from this little red dot, that's 
actually quite incredible. But for me personally, the biggest satisfaction actually comes from the 
fact that the culture of DBS has changed. Most people would tell you–it's a new DBS… The fact 
is that all of our people feel this immense sense of pride in what we are doing, and we're doing it 
anchored around this whole purpose of really trying to make banking joyful. People believe we 
are doing something different and meaningful. And that's a good feeling. 

Making Banking Joyful had been well received; in 2018, the net profit of the bank was S$5.63 billion, 
a 28%  increase from  2017 and return on equity was  12.1%. Digital  customers  bring in twice the 
income and have grown from 33% of the base in 2015 to 48% in 2018. 

DBS had set its sights to become the best bank in the world by 2020. Despite the accolades won and 
encouraging progress made so far, Piyush recognised that “We still have a lot of work to do before 
we can compare ourselves with Alibaba and Google”.

“4D Framework” 

Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver 

Discover  involved  researching  methodically  through  customer  immersion  and  then  analysing  the 
results. This may end up in different personas requiring different offers, which allows for a well-
articulated “job to be done”. 

Then the team methodically walks through every step the customer takes to Design the improved 
experience. 

As the team then moves to Develop, they keep in mind that it is not about the product features, but 
the whole customer experience and solving the job to be done. 

Only then do the team Deliver the job that had to be done.

Agile Auditing 

Derrick Goh, Managing Director and Head of Group Audit, shared, 

Audit is the third line of defence (after business and compliance) to detect and alert the bank to 
risk.  We  asked  ourselves  –  how  do  we  leverage  data  to  deliver  more  value  to  our  partner 
stakeholders, in order to hunt risk and deliver the findings earlier? 

The audit team began to periodically analyse 100% of the available data it had, rather than performing 
random sampling using a traditional cycle-based approach. It built the capability to extract this data 
itself,  instead  of  waiting for  the  business  to  provide it.  It  moved from  a  deductive  approach  to a 
predictive one, such as using machine learning to audit bank branches to detect patterns and identify 
which branches were at higher risk, and allocating more audit resources to those branches. 

The  audit  team  also  came  up  with  a  way  to  incorporate  ‘agile’  management  principles  into  its 
practices, which significantly improved its effectiveness as a unit and strengthened its partnership 
with business. While the traditional audit process would take up a lot of the business team’s time, the 
agile audit process (refer to Figure 1 below) would only require 15-minute ‘sprint’ sessions. Both 
sides would then discuss what actions should or should not be taken.

The  transparency,  efficiency  and  helpfulness  of  the  audit  process  brought  about  an  unexpected 
reversal of roles–-the business team started welcoming the opportunity to be audited, and requesting 
for audits to be performed, instead of the other way round. 

In 2015 and 2016, the audit team won the Institution of Engineers Singapore’s engineering awards 
for its innovation in technology and use of data analytics in predictive risk identification.

JoySpace 

DBS: Digital Transformation 

In 2017, the audit offices were transformed into ‘JoySpaces’ or activity-based workspaces. This was 
an open plan office that enabled employees to work, eat and relax. 

DBS audit scrum masters Bervia Chew and Cheryl Gan were unanimous when they explained that 
“An integral part of our transformation journey is to change the concept of the traditional back-
office to a more progressive, fun and customer centric office hub. With ‘Joyspace’, it further enabled 
us to foster a sense of community and collaboration among staff and simulate a community where 
ideas are germinated.”
