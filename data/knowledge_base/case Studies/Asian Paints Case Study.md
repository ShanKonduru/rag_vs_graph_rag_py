Manufacturing and Innovation
How we source
Our supply chain is designed to meet evolving customer preferences 
and increasing complexities. This approach gives us a competitive 
advantage and helps deliver superior value to customers. Our supply 
chain is designed to be a lean, agile, and reliable means for giving 
quality products at the right place, time and quantity and at optimum 
costs to enable customer delight.

Approach to supply chain
Our approach to supply chain is 
holistic in nature as our demand 
forecasting mechanisms serve as the 
foundation of the entire process, 
utilising real-time and historical data, 
market intelligence, and advanced 
statistical models, including machine 
learning algorithms, to generate 
accurate estimates at the depot SKU 
level. We leverage machine learning 
to further improve our processes 
enabling us to achieve industry-
leading forecast accuracy. 

Cutting-edge planning solutions are 
integrated in the supply chain by 
aligning production, deployment, 
and procurement plans with demand, 
optimising material availability 
while minimising procurement and 
consumption costs. 

Our planning process is seamlessly 
complemented by state-of-the-art 
execution, enabled by control towers 
providing real-time status updates 
and decision support for smooth 
service-to-market operations. 
We configure warehousing and 
logistics to handle scale and 
diversity effectively.

Supplier evaluation 
We follow a thorough stage-gate 
process to evaluate and onboard 
potential suppliers on various 
parameters. The evaluation 
covers quality, delivery, price 
competitiveness, legal compliance 
and critical ESG (Environmental, 
Social, and Governance) factors 
such as the comprehensiveness 
of environmental policies, 
implementation of management 
systems, and self-declaration on 
human rights issues. 

Supplier engagement 
We ensure our suppliers adhere to 
regulations beyond local standards, 
with tailored processes reflecting 
criticality, practicality, and business 
engagement nature. Our goal is to 
shape and enhance sustainability 
and governance practices through 
the implementation of different 
stages of Awareness, Assessment, 
and Association. During the year we 
organised ‘RAWCON’ a gathering 
of all our key suppliers under one 
roof to align our vision and enable 
mutual value creation. This event was 
attended by over 150 vendors.

C A S E S T U DY 

Packed with Potential: Sriperumbudur
Our Sriperumbudur packing team 
successfully transformed their 5S 
and autonomous maintenance 
practices, selecting one packing 
machine as a model. They 
brainstormed, sought external 
support, and studied best practices 
from other plants to boost 
their productivity and morale. 
Improvements included enhancing 
ergonomics, changing spare 
parts, colour-coding pipes, and 
implementing visual aids. 

With training and adherence 
to new standards, machine 
operations vastly improved 
within three months, leading 
to increased uptime, consistent 
output, and a happier workforce. 
This enormous success prompted 
the plant management to expand 
the model to other areas and 
spread the knowledge, facilitating 
transformation across various 
operations and bringing  
us one step closer to  
world-class standards.

Adjacencies 

White Cement
White Cement (Portland cement) is commonly used 
as a hydraulic binder in cement-based putty and 
waterproofing products, providing binding strength to 
the inorganic matrix upon hydration with water. We are 
in the process of establishing in-house manufacturing 
capabilities which enables customisation of cement 
grades for diverse applications in the undercoat and 
waterproofing segments.

Putty
To serve diverse markets with a bold service level promise, 
we have maintained and improved high-quality standards 
while enhancing procurement efficiency in FY 2023-24. A 
notable achievement in our manufacturing expansion was 
the establishment of our in-house Putty plant in Rohtak. 
Furthermore, our efforts to enhance formulation efficiency

•  Upgraded Damp Sheath Interior, 

the first waterproofing undercoat 
with a three-year warranty in the 
value-for-money category 

•  Flash, a distinctive wood polish 
offering superior grain filling 
and gloss

Right First Time 

We place a significant emphasis 
on delivering right the first time, 
ensuring that our products meet 
the highest standards of quality, 
every time. Our R&T team led the 
charge in ensuring that our design, 
processing, and product validation 
protocols were world-class, resulting 
in impeccable product quality that 
resonated with our customers.

Backward integration

Characterisation of products

We made significant progress in 
our backward integration projects, 
achieving critical milestones in 
the year. Some of the notable 
accomplishments include substantial 
progress in the development of 
Vinyl Acetate Ethylene Emulsion 
(VAE) based polymers, with ongoing 
evaluations of prototypes for 
integration into products.

Project Samarthya  

The project on backward 
integration of specialty 
additives, Project Samarthya 
yielded critical additives at 
attractive price points. This 
has reduced our vulnerability 
concerning the availability 
of critical additives and has 
also helped us to deliver 
enhanced performance 
properties in products at 
optimal price points.

The economically developed 
functional raw materials have also 
paved the way for enhancing product 
properties at unprecedented price 
points. In addition to advancing 
product performance, the 
knowledge base cultivated from 
our initiatives has strengthened our 
understanding of the relationship 
between structure-property 
relationship and process engineering.

Our Physical Characterisation and 
Analytical Research (PCAR) team 
collaborated closely with the resin 
and product development teams to 
establish the characteristics of the 
raw materials, intermediates and 
products developed by applying 
modern in-house techniques during 
backward integration. Under this 
initiative, we were able to develop 
test methods for analysing and 
characterising additives, as well 
as gaseous analytes essential for 
VAE manufacturing.

Sikshalaya – Asian Paints’ 
Training Academy 

Asian Paints’ training academy, 
Sikshalaya, continues to maintain its 
focus on providing technical training 
and skill development for R&T 
employees. Six specialised courses 
in the fields of colour science, 
dispersion, statistical techniques, 
and microbiology are offered, and 
employees receive comprehensive 
training from external experts of 
global repute to enhance proficiency 
across various domains. 

The certificate course on Paint 
Formulation and Characterisation 
has been particularly beneficial for 
lateral recruits and freshers from 
non-paint backgrounds. Overall, 
about 150 R&T employees have 
benefited from these programmes.

Influencers 

In FY 2023-24, we prioritised the 
automation and streamlining of 
processes such as onboarding, 
offboarding, and asset allocation, 
leveraging tools like Autopilot 
for automated asset allocation. 
Additionally, we made investments 
towards learning platforms like 
LinkedIn to enrich the learning 
experience for our people. 

During the year, our businesses 
transitioned to a cloud-based CRM 
system to increase efficiency and 
effectiveness in operations. This 
automation has empowered our 
sales teams and leadership team to 
make real-time data-driven decisions, 
leading to increased market 
opportunities, sales pipelines,

Optimising logistics has become 
crucial over the years for enhancing 
customer satisfaction amidst 
evolving preferences. We focus 
on customer-centricity, employing 
lean, agile, and reliable methods to 
deliver quality products promptly 
and utilise demand forecasting 
for real-time and historical data, 
supported by advanced statistical 
models and machine learning 
algorithms, resulting in significantly 
reduced errors post-COVID. We 
are actively incorporating machine 
learning models to enable frequent 
demand sensing, enhancing 
inventory management and 
minimising stockouts, ultimately 
improving order fill rates. We have 
also deployed a more advanced 

Order Fill Rate (OFR) tracking. Our 
dealer feedback indicates noticeable 
enhancements in material servicing, 
reflecting the effectiveness of 
automation in prioritising and 
dispatching critical SKUs across 
the country.

Furthermore, we have deployed a 
new inventory optimiser tool which 
has led to reduced inventory norms 
by approximately 5%, enhancing 
service levels. Direct material 
dispatch to customers without 
warehousing has yielded significant 
cost savings and faster delivery 
times, in FY 2023-24. Moreover, we 
are increasing regional distribution 
centres to further accelerate 
servicing for slow-moving items 
while reducing freight costs.
