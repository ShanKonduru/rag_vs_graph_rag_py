The DNA of Disruption: How Latent Needs Reshape IT

My IT career began in 1992 at GP Cotton and Oil company Limited as a Data Entry Operator cum Programmer. The technological landscape of that era was vastly different from today's – the internet was absent, desktop PCs had limited RAM, and we relied on 5.2-inch floppy disks to bootstrap the system with MSDOS and use the Windows 3.1 GUI. Our daily tools included WordStar for document management, Lotus 123 for spreadsheets, dot matrix printer for hard copies, and dBase III+ and FoxBase are most famous databases. Our primary programming languages were Cobol, Fortran 77, Pascal, and GW Basic.

Just five to six years later, in 1997, the IT world had already begun a significant shift. While still in its early stages for many, the internet was gaining momentum. Creating a Google email account required a referral, and multiple search engines were competing for prominence. Client-server architecture was the prevailing model, and the concept of a powerful handheld computer remained a futuristic notion.

Looking back over the subsequent 30 plus years, the transformation has been truly revolutionary. For those of us in IT, our careers have been a constant process of adapting to disruptive forces and adopting the innovative tools and technologies that have arisen. 

This article aims to explore the major IT disruptions we've experienced since the 1990s. Beyond simply cataloging these changes, it will also delve into the latent needs that drove them - the fundamental human desires and business imperatives that spurred these technological leaps and the innovative tools and technologies that have not only tackled these challenges but have also ushered in entirely new ways of working.

Disruption #1 - Dotcom boom:

The late 1990s and early 2000s were marked by the dawn of the internet era and the dot-com disruption. The rapid proliferation of web-based companies and the promise of a new digital economy fueled unprecedented investment and excitement. Businesses rushed to establish an online presence, leading to the development of early e-commerce platforms and a growing demand for high-speed internet infrastructure. However, the speculative bubble burst dramatically, serving as a crucial lesson in the viability of online business models and the importance of sustainable growth. This disruption, while painful for many, laid the groundwork for the internet as a fundamental platform for commerce, communication, and information sharing, driving the evolution of more robust and scalable online technologies.
