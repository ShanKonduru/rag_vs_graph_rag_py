TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA

INTRODUCTION 

As a religious institution and place of worship, the temple in India has had a hoary past. As a structure that enshrines a god or some other object of veneration, circumambulation (pradakshina), adoration and worship (puja), it has had a varied growth in different parts of the subcontinent. This was according to the local needs and credal requirements and subject, of course, to the interplay or exchange of thoughts and ideas. Though fundamentally the basic elements of the temples and the worship in them derived mostly from Vedic and Puranic sources, in course of centuries they assumed different styles and patterns during their diffusion over wide areas from the cradle centres of the great Indian religions in north India. The rise of the protestant cults of Jainism and Buddhism during the pre-Christian epoch and the development of their own versions of the legends, creeds, forms of deities, rituals and the like, resulted in their adaptation of one kind or another of the temple form and its adjuncts as suited the object of their particular worship and its glorification, for essentially the temple in its form and layout depended on the object of veneration installed and the method adopted for its worship. The three creeds being indigenous, and not exotic, had not to derive the basic forms of their temples from anywhere except from their-own land of origin. All the three, while retaining the common Indian plans and elevations, and the native principles and techniques of construction, had, however, to show their credal distinctions by suitable adaptations of their forms and through emphasis on the features of the cognitions of the respective creeds in the general make-up and content of the Structure. 

The builders or the craftsmen—stapatis and the silpins—who belonged to the same guilds of artisans, had common principles and setj methods of design and construction and they worked in collaboration with the priesthood which knew’ the rituals, the nature of the objects of veneration, and the modes of their worship. They together determined the forms of the temples with such modifications as suited the respective cases, as also the fixation of the features of the principal deities and the decorations of the structure with iconic and other sculptural embellishments. As a result, the Vastu, Silpa and Agama text and canons as described in the Sastras were evolved. All that was known and necessary in the creation .of the temple and the conduct of worship therein was codified. Thus to the Indian mind the indigenous architecture remains basically and essentially Indian. It cannot be sub-divided into what is usually attempted to be made out as ‘Hindu’, ‘Jain’, or ‘Buddhist’ architecture. 

The organized religions, Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, did, in their early stages of growth, spread into the southern peninsula across the Vindhyan barrier of mountains and forests, because of their own vitality, in successive waves, merging into the religions of the south which had viable cultures, social patterns, traditions and religious beliefs of their own, not to speak of a language that could flower into its own literature, independently of every other factor. A greater impetus to these contacts was ‘given by the Mauryan conquests that reached the northern borders of the Mysore plateau, beyond which Asoka, the great patron of Buddhism, recognised viable, stable and organized kingdoms of the far south, with their own indigenous culture. He treated them as friendly neighbours across the border among whom he could spread his message through his southern administrators. 

The tradition of rock-cut architecture and excavation into living rock of chaityas and viharas of the Buddhists initiated by Asoka near Gaya was soon taken up in the trap rock regions of the- Deccan and western India, reproducing aspects of contemporary brick-and-timber originals which, because of the perishable nature of the fabric of their construction, did not survive the march of time. This expression of forms of architecture and -sculpture througa the permanent medium of stone, adopted earlier by the Buddhists, then by the Hindus and the Jains, has enabled the monuments to last for centuries and give us a fairly good idea of 

what the contemporary religious architecture and sculpture in general was. The brick-built stupas and chaityas, which are in essence temples, in the eastern. Andhra and northern Karnataka regions, too, have survived because of the adoption of stone for their protective casing and sculptured veneer, not to mention the stone railings which totally imitated timberwork in their joinery and fixtures. In these cases stone cannot be said to have gone into actual construction which was still of brick. These stupas and chaityas show their own distinct regional characters as against their compeers in north and north-western India. 

“From the sixth and seventh centuries A.D., the Hindus and Jains of the south too adopted the stone medium, and started excavating rock-cut cave-temples, or carving out rock-cut monolithic temple forms, and ultimately building them of stone. We have a long series of such stone temples created in close succession and extending uninterruptedly through the past thirteen centuries surviving in their thousands all over the peninsula, more to the far south where most of them are still in use. The ‘comparative freedom from foreign invasions and disruption in this part of India and the relative strength of the kingdoms and society were some of the contributing factors. Even the early Hindu and Jain temples came into being under the royal patronage of the rulers of the three great empites of the south—the Chalukyas, the Pallavas and the Pandyas—along with the lesser kingdoms wedged in between. The spirit was soon caught up by the nobility, the mercantile corporations and the agricultural trade, and artisan guilds that flourished during those times.. The result was that a chain of temples, great and small, studded every village and town of the south, which thus came to be known as the land of temples. The temples were documented by their own expressive and detailed inscriptions, again in their thousands. Temples from the Chola times (ninth-tenth centuries) became the very hub of the rural and urban life in all its aspects — 

religious, cultural, social, economic and educational—and thus became the repository of all that was best in fabric, architecture, sculpture and other arts. 

Buddhism almost went into complete eclipse soon, the Hindu temples tc. a greater extent and the Jain ones to a lesser extent predominating. There had been, of course, a natural interchange of ideas and usages among the three during their periods of development and growth in the region on a matrix that was essentially indigenous. The Buddha, for instance, was adopted as the ninth of the ten incarnations of Vishnu in the Hindu pantheon in place of Krishna, who came to be considered as the whole aspect of Vishnu. This is testified by a Pallava inscription of the seventh century A.D. in one of the early cave-temples at Mahabalipuram. Then again, Buddhist fantric rituals percolated into the Hindu modes of worship. The Jains had by then established their Sangas at Madurai, and even earlier their creed of the Digambara persuasion had centred principally in Sravana-Belagola in Mysore with its affiliates and branches—the guchchhas—radiating into Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Hinduism witnessed a great revival under the Saiva saints (Nayanmars) and the Vaishnava saints (Alvars) who were soon defined and became part and parcel of the pantheon and in the ritual and calendar of festivals. Sankara, the great philosopher and teacher, also reformed the popular Hindu creeds—the Shanmata and the model of the related worship. With such a background the growth of temples and organised temple worship became truly phenomenal. 

The southern temples with their characteristic tiered vimana shrines, major and minor, their axial and peripheral mandapa adjuncts, which are flat-roofed halls, and the towering gopura entrances form a distinct class by themselves as against the northern prasada temples with their curvilinear superstructures, the crowning amalaka and mandapas with rising tiered roofs. That the vimana form in its various plans and elevations built of brick-and-timber had been already developed in the south before the seventh century will be only too evident from the maturity shown by the first monolithic replicas as reproduced in the so-called rathas of Mahabalipuram and the earliest of the stone structural vimanas. The mandapa. forms are likewise evident from the cave-temple types, while the gopura in its simplest form is also to be found in the early temple units. They could not have arisen in stone spontaneously 

The prevailing maritime contacts with the regions of the east in the Indian Ocean, which were actuated more by trade and emigration than by motives of political aggrandizement and were, therefore, peaceful and the resultant emigrations of colonists, lent much to the contemporary make-up of the religion, culture, art and architecture of these lands. South Indian temple architecture, sculpture and iconography may be said to have had а great share in this. In fact, it may be said that many of the greatest achievements in the fields of religion, art and architecture are said to be found in regions beyond the cradle centres of the great religions in south India—as at Thanjavur and Madurai, and in other lands as in Java and Cambodia. 

Thus in an integrated scheme of a study of the temples of India, the southern temples have perforce to be studied independently in order to understand not only their origin and mode of development through time and space into the varied regional styles, but also the similarities and differences and the mutual influences of Ње їмо great traditions, northern and southern. An attempt has been made in the following pages to portray in outline the temples of the south. Since even the simplest architectural and art terms of European classical origin, often employed in the description of Indian temples, are inadequate and not always apt, the barest use of Indian technical terms of common Sanskrit origin for the most important parts, as used in the Vastu and Silpa manuals, has been made. The terms most of which are familiar to temple-goers of the south are riot only explained in the course of the running description bur also collected in a glossary at the end, so that they can eventually be put to a more purposeful use.

THE BEGINNINGS—EARLY TEMPLES 



THE cULT of worship of objects or phenomena considered super-human in a specified manner and in specified places has been one of the traits of mankind from very remote times. The early form of such practices can only be deduced from literary evidences, traditions and material relics. That have come down to us in the course of the centuries. A fairly vivid picture of life and organised worship in the ancient Tamilakam, the country of the Tamils, in the southernmost part of the peninsula that included what is now Kerala also, is supplied by the earliest available literature in Tamil, dating from the commencement of the Christian era, if not before it. The extant portion of this vast literature embodies in itself earlier and contemporary traditions, many of which still persist. 

The material evidence would be the numerous megalithic monuments of diverse variety and shape that have survived. These monuments which are funerary or sepulchral in character are, by far, the largest group of extant early monuments in the south and are very widely distributed all over the area south of the Vindhyas. These monuments, characterised by the association of large stones, reveal by their character and contents a highly evolved material culture, as can also be deduced from the numerous references found in the early Tamil literatures of the Sangam epoch and later. Here is mention of the erection and veneration with accompanying ritual of the monuments raised in honour of the dead, for example, the nadukal or *stone-erection'. This culture which had its beginnings somewhere in the middle of the first millennium B.C., if not earlier, prevailed in the south till the middle of the. First millennium A.D. and continued in some modified or restricted form for centuries thereafter. In the same body of literature we also get glimpses of other gods and spirits worshipped by the common people, as also their religious practices prevalent, perhaps, much before the advent of the great proselytizing religions of Brahmanism (more conveniently denoted as Hinduism), Jainism and Buddhism, not to mention another important religion, that of the Ajivikas. The. worship of local gods and the animistic worship of spirits inhabiting trees, rivers and hills, or of the guardians of villages, cities, cross-roads, sea-shores, and river ports or ghats, lakes and tanks were similar in essence to what obtained in north India (Yakshas, bhutas and devatas), where we have the classic instance of the infant Buddha being taken soon after birth to the shrine of the Yaksha Sakya Vardhana. 





THE HYPAETHRAL TEMPLES 1 





The worship of trees as the abode of spirits and gods was once 

very popular. These spirits were associated with many trees, such 

as the A! (Banyan), Arasu (Pipal), Irarti (Zizyphus or the Jujube), 

Ilanji, Kadamba, Pala (Jack), Vakai' (Albizzia), Vanni (Prosopis), 

Velli (wood-apple), Vembu (Neem), Vengai (Pterocarpus), etc. The 

Kadamba tree is said to be the abode of Murugan (Kartikeya), and 

the AI (Banyan) that of Siva. The Ahananuru, one of the earliest 

Tamil works, describes a Banyan tree in worship as surrounded by 

a brick enclosure and to which offerings were madc. This would 

appear to be an instance of a tree-temple or vriksha-chaitya that 

was not particularly Buddhistic. The Tamil epic Silappadikaram, a 

work somewhat later in point of time, however, mentions a Podi- 

manram, or temple of the Bodhi-tree, a vriksha-chaitya of Buddhist 

affiliations designated as Bodhi-ghara (Bodhi-grika) in Buddhist 

literature. All these would constitute a class of hypaethral temples, 

that is, temples open to the air and devoid of a roof over the 

object of worship. 





1 Open temples, with no roof. 





8 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





From archaeological evidence, it would be clear that this concep- 

tion of tree-worship is very ancient, dating back to ће Harappan 

times. As in the south, so also in north India there Are references 

in early Buddhist texts to their existence even prior to'the Buddha, 

In Buddhist literature such tree-shrines, with or without a temple 

structure and not specifically Buddhistic, are referred to. as 

rukka-chaitya (vriksha-chaityas or chaitya-vrikshas) or tree-temples, 

while those around the Bodhi-tree that had become sacred to the 

Buddhists are called Bodhi-gharas. The Bodhi-tree at Uruvela was 

considered sacred, even before Buddhist times, as the abode of a 

devata or divine being (Yaksha) to whom offerings were made and 

from whom marriage and fertility boons were prayed for. The 

honour or worship offered to other sacred trees was similar, as, for 

example, in regard to the offering of flowers and garlands, bathing 

or purification with scented water, spreading of clean sand around 

their bases or building of platforms (varam) or other roofed 

galleries round tlieir trunks to enable perambulation and the per- 

formance of the other functions and rituals as mentioned above. 

Sometimes even railings or enclosure walls were constructed and 

decked with flags, buntings and parasols. 



Since construction around the sacred tree was meant not only to 

be honorific but also to meet the needs of the rituals of worship, it 

took definite architectural shapes in different plans. This is evident 

from the sculptural representations in relief of Bodhi-gharas in 

north and south Indian Buddhist sites, dating back as early as the 

second century в.с. The Bodhi-ghara is always represented as a 

high gallery, open or roofed, immediately surrounding the Bodhi- 

tree and the yajrasana at its foot, with definitely posed entrances, 

Into the enclosed sacred area, the Bodhi-manda. In Asokavadana, 

the emperor Asoka, in fulfilment of his vow, is stated to have 



poured scented water from a thousand vessels by mounting on an 

enclosure (varam) which he had erected on all the four sides of the 

celebrated Bodhi-tree at Bodh Gaya. Of the two Amaravati versions 

of the Bodhi-ghara in south India, one is intact, though poorly 

preserved, and the other is fragmentary. The former, essentially 





THE BEGINNINGS—EARLY TEMPLES 9 



square in plan, with the ends of the sides extended slightly beyond 

at each intersecting corner, has an unusually high second floor or 

gallery over the ground level. This was perhaps made accessible, as 

should be the case also in the othér examples, by suitably placed 

flight of steps not seen in the relief representations. On plan. it 

would have four sets of eight pillars each at the four corners, four: 

of each set occupying each of the real corners, while four more are 

placed in advance of each set in two pairs in front of the corners. 

The other Amaravati relief is triple-storeyed and circular on plan. 

This too has tall pillars on the ground floor, supporting the two 

storeys above. The celebrated Bahuputra-chaitya of Vaisali, which 

was one of the Buddha's favourite resorts during his many visits to 

Vaisali, is depicted on one face of'an Amaravati stele," to indicate 

Vaisali in the narrative depiction of the Buddha's last visit to that 

place, though he did not stay at this chaitya that time. This part 

of the scene has three trees, with the bases of two of them enclos- 

ed by a railing. The most prominent one on the right, with the 

railing round it, is shown as being worshipped by two devotees, 

one with folded hands and the other holding out a baby towards 

the tree. This has also an inscription below it, calling it “Bahu- 

putra-chaitya of Vaisali”. This would be a rendering of a vriksha- 

chaitya with a simple railing denoting its antiquity, for the stele arid 

the inscriptions are of post-Asokan times. According to Buddha- 

ghosha, this was a many-branched tree where people prayed for 

sons. The depiction accordingly of one praying for the boon, and 

the other, having obtained it, presenting it in gratitude and for it 

to be blessed further is appropriate.* 



In short the Bodhi-ghara structures around the principal object 

of worship would thus anticipate the cloister galleries (or dalans)

2 The Arasu (Pipal) tree, often combined with the Vembu (Neem) on river 

banks, or tank bunds, or other sacred spots, is even today an object of worship 

and perambulation by those desirous of progeny, and this Asvatranarayana- 

pradakshina, as it is called, is considered to be beneficial on Mondays which 

are also new-moon days. The Arasu is also considered sacred to Vishnu— 

Naryana or Janardhana and the pitris, or departed manes, whose blessings are 

to be invoked for good progeny. 





10 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





round the roofed temple structures, or vimanas, often more tham 

one-storeyed, enshrining the object of worship. These cloister gal- 

leries are designated in the Tamil inscriptions-and texts as malikai 

(malika) as also in the Silpa and Agama literature on temple 

architecture. The only. difference is that while the carly examples 

surround hypaethral shrínes which are not covered by а roof, the 

later malikais surround roofed-shrines or vimanas containing the 

object of worship or the deity. 



The very ancient and deep-rooted cult of tree worship continued 

in south India, particularly the Tamil country, even after organized 

temple worship of the Hindu cults had grown. This would be seen 

in the association of religious places, or sthalas, with particular 

trees, the, sthala-vrikshas, along with a particular water course, 

river, lake or tank, the sirtha. A place of important pilgrimage ‘is 

even now called a sthala, or a tirtha, and a sacred place must neces- 

sarily have a.combination of sthala, vriksha and tirtha, along with 

the murti, or god-head. For example, the sthala-vriksha in Chidam- 

baram is the Titlai (Aquillaria), in Jambukesvaram (near Tiruchi- 



.rapalli) the Jambu, in the Ekamranatha at Kanchi the Amra, and 



in Madurai the Kadamba. There are numerous.such instances, and 

they are mostly Saiva in association. Further the early Tamil works 

associate particular trees, such as the Kaval maram (totem trees) 

with kings and ruling chiefs. The Panai, the Atti and the Vembu 

were, for example, the emblems, respectively, of the Chera, Chola 

and Pandya kings. 



The other type of hypaethral temple brought into vogue by the 

Buddhists was the stupa, often, called maha-chaitya. Before its. 

advent in the south, the stupa which had begun as a low hemisphe- 

rical solid dome or anda had developed into one where the anda 

was raised over a distinct cylindrical drum, the medhi. The medhi, 

being of a larger diameter than the anda above, provided a narrow 

eircumambulatory passage, pradakshina, often with a low balustrade 

on its edge at a higher level in addition to the one on the ground 

level at its base. The balustrade was formed of vertical panels or 



“slabs morticed between upright pillars planted at intervals. The 





THE BEGINNINGS —EARLY TEMPLES 11 





medhi was often projected as offsets on the four cardinal sides in 

the shape of small platforms, the ayaka platforms for the place- 

ment of offerings in simpler cases of the stupa. In other cases, 

flights of steps were provided for access. In some other cases, the 

ayaka platforms had each a set of five tall pillars planted on their 

outer edges. These were called ayaka pillars. On the top of the arida 

is the harmika square on plan and enclosing an umbrella (chhatra) 

or a series of them (chhatravali). The whole structure is often sur- 

rounded by a railing with plain openings on the four sides, and 

not the elaborate torana entrances as at Sanchi. The brick-built 

stupa had its anda and medhi and the ayaka platforms. In the 

earlier and simpler examples, these are merely plastered over, with 

a large looped garland girdling the anda picked out in stucco as an 

adornment. In others of the Krishna valley and adjacent areas, 

they were encased by a series of curved slabs of the local limestone 

—the marble-like soft Palnad limestone—that can be quarried into 

thin and large slabs and easily carved. The railing was also of the 

same material and carved likewise. The carvings consist of scenes 

from the various legends about the Buddha and also his life-story, 

besides other ornamental and decorative sculptures and motifs. 



While the earlier larger and smaller stupas were solid and some- 

times massive, the rest were semi-hollow and had adaptations of 

internal structural designs of brickwork with plans like the spoked 

wheel, the Swastika, square within circles, ctc., with the interspaces 

packed with rubble. All these were expedients designed to conserve 

brick and at the same time enhance the strength and stability of 

the structure which was to bear the weight of the immense hemi- 

sphere and also of the casing of limestone slabs. These independent 

stupas or maha-chaityas containcd relic caskets preserving frag- 

mentary portions of the relics of the Buddha, or some other great 

master, suitably hidden and sealed inside. 



The ruined maha-chaitya at Amaravati had its foundations laid 

in Asokan times. It was subsequently enlarged and encased with 

carved and sculptured limestone slabs with a stone railing. In the 

earlier phase here, as in the stupas at Bhattiprolu, Jaggayyapeta 





12 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





and "Garikapadu, the ayaka-platform alone came to be more elabo- 

rately sculptured in its stone casing as compared to the rest of the 

drum. This was consistent with the fact that the ayaka extensions 

served as altars for placing flowers, lamps and offerings by the 

devotees. The drum had more or less plain slabs with little carving, 

except perhaps for the low-relief pilasters at the edges. These 

pilasters carried animal figures over their bell-shaped capitals. In 

addition, there were figures of devotees flanking the Buddha's 

symbols. Even during subsequent renovations the sculptors devoted 

greater attention to the ayaka platform, as in the case of the other 

stupas elsewhere. The parapet slabs of the' circumambulatory 

Passage over the medhi had their inner faces finely carved as in the 

maha-chaityas of Nagerjunakonda, Jaggayyapeta, Ghantasala and 

Pedda-Ganjam. These slabs were morticed between uprights placed 

at intervals over the outer circumference with a running moulded , 





, coping on top. The stone railing dating earlier than 200 B.c. was 





also enlarged in the course of reconstruction and emerged in its 

final architectural and embellished form between A.D. 150 to 200. 

"After this came the last phase of embellishment of the stupa when 

many of the earlier sculptured casing slabs of the basal parts were 

reversed and their erstwhile unsculptured inner faces trimmed and 

covered with some of the finest sculptures. This was done during 

the period A.D. 200 to 250. 



The large maha-chaitya of Nagarjunakonda, built early in 

Ikshvaku times, belongs to the class of uncased sfupas. Its brick- 

work has been mostly plastered over, and the anda decorated by an 

immense garland ornament in stucco. But unlike the Amaravati 

stupa which was built solid, this stupa had а central column with 





-eight radial walls meeting a peripheral circular wall, thus producing 





the appearance, on plan, of a cart-wheel with its hub, spokes aud 

felly. There was a second concentric outer wall with furthér projec- 

tions of the radial walls between it and the inner circular wall, the 

two circular walls forming, respectively, the bases of the anda and 

the medhi, while the inner cross-walls-with fillings between them 

afforded the necessary structural support. It probably also had an 





THE BEGINNINGS—EARLY TEMPLES 13 





outer circular railing. Many of the other stupas in this area had 

stone casings With sculputures and they also invariably had a stone 

railing. The ayaka platforms, though generally seen in the stupas of 

this area, are not noticed in the stupas at Ramatirtham and Sali- 

hundam, while they are seen only on one side of the rock-cut stupa 

at Sankaram. Likewise in the case of the Buddhist stupas on the 

east coast, lying between Nagarjunakonda and Amaravati on one 

side and Salihundam on the other, stupas like those at Sankaram 

have the ayaka platforms on one of their sides, 



Yt is to be noted in this context, that while the Amaravati stupa 

revealed below its levels urn-burials, the site of Nagarjunakonda 

has shown the prevalence of the stupas with almost contemporan- 

eous megalithic monuments. Such associations of megalithic sites 

and stupa sites are numerous in the Deccan, Andhra and north 

Mysore areas, roughly coinciding with the southern tracts of the 

Mauryan empire and the regions where Buddhism, among other 

northern religions, had a greater influence. This perhaps gave rise 

to the cult of the worship and reverence of the stupa, which is 

essentially funerary in content as well as by association. This was 

easily assimilable in this area which had an earlier megalithic 

tradition. For the same reason, therefore, one can assume that 

stone, which was primarily associated with the dead and the cult 

of tlie dead for many centuries, could be adopted in the make-up 

of these essentially brick-built stupas, either as a protective veneer 

or as a surrounding enclosure or rail, and in columns that were 

free. standing. or structural supports. However, in constrast to the 

highly developed technique of brick construction, the structural 

patterns in stone were elementary and did not extend beyond 

simple casing or joining, as in the rails and balustrades, of cross- 

pieces. or slabs with tenons to morticed uprights. This was pure 

imitation of timberwork, a simulation of carpentry in stone. Actual 

stone construction involving structural principles of design, support, 

coursing and breaking of joints, counteraction of thrusts and loads, 

had not yet been developed. 



In the extreme south, beyond the southernmost reaches of the: 





14 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Mauryan empire, where, according to the Asokan inscriptions, the 

Tamil kingdoms of the Cheras, Pandyas, Cholas and Satyaputas 

flourished, there is almost a paucity of Buddhist stupas. But con- 

temporary literature speaks of Buddhism, along with the three 

other religions from the north which appear to have had a stronger 

hold in this area, particularly Hinduism and Jainism. The Ajivikas 

are heard of even towards the close of the first millennium A.D. 

and perhaps they merged into Jainism, which was predominantly 

Digambara, and had strong footholds in the southern Mysore or 

Kannada region also. 



The megalithic cult was popular and worship and veneration of 

funerary monuments are frequently described, particularly the 

nadukal or stone erection (menheir or megalith) with offerings in- 

cluding toddy and animal sacrifice, keeping lamps lighted, and 

oblations of large quantities of boiled rice in heaps (perumchoru or 

pavadai). The dead, atcording to the literary evidence, were believ- 

ed to have become stone itself which had acquired divine proper- 

ties. A stone could be a hero, a warrior, a king, or even an ordinary 

person. Women who immolated themselves on the death of their 

husbands, at a time when the cult of chastity and faithfulness was 

spreading fast, were given memorials in the nature of -sati stones, 

later called in inscriptions toru or masatikkal (maha-sati-kal). Such 

memorial or sari stones, belonging to the'second-third centuries A.D., 

are found with inscriptions and sculptural reliefs in the Andhra 

sites, particularly at Nagarjunakonda, and are called chhaya-khabas 

or chhaya-khambas. These are also common in the Kannada 

country and across the borders in the peripheral regions of the 

Tamil country from the fourth century onwards. The early Tamil 

works speak of such a stone erection or nadukal in many contexts 

on which were written, evidently with ochre paint and brush, or 

later inscribed the name and exploits of the dead person it repre- 

sented. This object of worship was surrounded by an enclosure, 

and a spear and shield were planted in front, and offerings of food 

and toddy were made. This instance of hypaethral temple is re- 

presented by a similar ancient construction on the Rangasami Peak 





THE BEGINNINGS—EARLY TEMPLES 15 





in the Coimbatore district, with a menheir or upright stone, having 

a trident or trisula planted in front and surrounded by a rubble 

wall. 



The sculptured hero-stone slab or virakal, so erected in memory 

Of, or over the grave of, the dead Него, was often flanked on 

either side, in front of the sculptured slab stele, by two more lateral 

slabs and*the whole topped by a horizontally laid roof-slab, thus 

enclosing a roofed space. The formation can be called a dolmen- 

shrine because it comprises three orthostatic slabs and a roof slab, 

like a dolmen, but contains the sculptured figure, that is venerated, 

on the inner face of its back wall. Such shrines called Armanmar 

kovil abound in the western districts of Tamil Nadu, in.the Kongu 

area, and the adjoining districts of the Mysore plateau on the west 

in the Karnataka area. Besides the relief sculpture they Carrry ins- 

criptions of the seventh-eighth centuries and later. 



Temples as places of worship—the podiyil or manram, or murram 

—had objects of worship that were very often mere mounds or 

platforms—medai—under a particular tree in the village. Sometimes 

they were trilithons of a stone-slab placed over two uprights—the 

terri which survive even today in some remote parts. Some of the 

platforms had a post, or kandu, representing the deity planted over 

them. These shrines are described as kandudai-p-podiyil, meaning 

the common place ОЁ worship where the kandu is installed. From 

some of the brief descriptions in the earliest Tamil works, we learn 

that the kandu, as the abode of a deity, stood in a pillared hall, 

or podiyil, on a platform that was cleansed and smeared with 

water and cowdung by young women who, after a dip in the 

bathing ghat, lighted an ever-burning lamp near the kandu. We 

are also told that many came here to worship with offerings or 

bali. 



The Buddha-pitikai or Dharma-pitikai as the object of worship 

by the Buddhists is referred to in the Tamil epic, Manimekalai. 

From its brief description it would appear to have been a circular 

padma pitha, or seat of expanding lotus petals, mounted over a 

square plinth, also witli a lotus petal base, the whole evidently of 





16 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





brickwork. A solitary example of a Buddha-pada, the tiruvadi (or 

punya-pada) of the master, as an object of worship, has come up 

from the recent excavations of the ancient Chola port city of 

Kaveri-p-pattinam at the mouth of the river Kaveri. It is а carved 

slab of Palnad limestone of about the fourth century A.D. and 

perhaps formed the top piece of a brick platform. It was probably 

originally installed in a shrine for worship. These two instances 

would show that, in the absence of stupas as objects of worship in 

the Tamil country, it was the Buddha-pitikai and the Buddha-pada 

that were worshipped till the much later advent of the iconic forms 

of the Buddha in stone or other materials. 



Recent excavations in the Gudimallam temple in Chittoor on the 

Tamil Nadu-Andhra border have revealed tbe fact that the Zinga 

with its pitha, both of sandstone, were originally hypaethral in the 

second century B.C. А brick shrine enclosing it came up in the first- 

second centuries A.D. to be replaced by a stone apsidal one, much 

Jater. The brick shrine was apsidal too (Dr. I.K. Sharma). 





THE ROOFED TEMPLES 





Where roofed structures were built enshrining such platforms, 

cult objects, symbols or iconic representations, they imitated secular | 

buildings in the plan and style of construction. The only difference 

was that the temples were made of more permanent material, like 

brick and wrought timber, more lavishly decorated with plaster, 

stucco, carving and painting, and often larger in dimensions in 

contrast to the humbler mud-and-wattle-walled, thatch-roofed 

houses of the common folk. 



None of these temples has survived in the Tamil land though 

we have enough word pictures of these simple or storeyed cons- 

tructions in the Tamil Sangam classics. One, for example, describes 

a temple with high brick walls and wooden beams, containing in- 

side, on its back wall, the painted picture of the deity or Kadavul 

that was worshipped, indicating that it was either a mural painting 

or a stucco figure, or sometimes a carved wooden plaque that 





` 





THE BEGINNINGS—EARLY TEMPLES 17 





constituted the principal object of worship in the more sophisti- 

cated temples of the time. Such temples or shrines, mostly of brick- 

and-timber, are variously designated in the Sangam works as 

Kottam, Nagaram, Koyil and Palli. Evidently these names indicate 

different plans and styles of construction. The epic Manimekalai 

speaks of temples built of brick and having imposing entrances or 

gopuras. Some of these temples were storcyed mudums, and these 

included memorial shrines also. The custom of building such me- 

morial shrines, called Palli-p-padai in Tamil, continued суеп in the 

ninth and tenth centuries A.D. as testificd by the Tamil and 

Kannada inscriptions. 



In the ancient Tamil country cf the far south, as. its early 

literature also reveals, various gods are represented as presiding 

over different tracts of the country, namely, the.hilly, the sylvan 

or pastoral, the riverine or agricultural, the desert or arid zones, 

and the littoral or seaside.Such gods were Scyon, Mayon, Ven- 

dan, Valiyon, Korravai or Kadukal. There were, in addition, other 

minor gods. It was in the centuries preceding and following the 

Christian era that the dynamic religions of the Vedic Hindus, the 

Jains, the Ajivikas, and the Bauddhas of the north made definite 

and vital impacts on the cultural, linguistic and religious substra- 

tum of the south. This also coincided with the extent of the 

political map of the Mauryas, with the extreme south beyond its 

limits maintaining a strong indigenous core with a viable culture, 

language and a fast-growing literature under organised kingdoms. 

The incoming people found it expedient to cultivate the local 

languages in order to expound better their ideas of religion and 

ritual and actively contributed by taking a large share themselves 

in the growth of the literature and grammar of the Tamil language. 

There are many among the Sangam pcets, who were Brahmins or 

Jains. The same happened to the Kannada language a little later. 

Thus, the impact resulted in the importation and infusion in 

various degrees of new thoughts and ideas by the incoming reli- 

gious cultures, as also а simultaneous absorption of much that 

was local. The phenomenon that occurred as a result of such 





18 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





impact of the culture and religions of India in the countries of the 

Far East such as Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Indo- 

nesia, producing a synthesis of godheads and local modified 

versions of the legends, iconography and ritual, occurred here also 

more or less. For example, Hinduism, particularly in the Tamil 

country, which included much of Kerala also, became eclectic by 

absorbing the local deities and concepts in the pantheon and 

ritual, or by identifying them with many of its own. The local 

Mayon was identified with Krishna or Vishnu, Valiyon with 

Balabhadra, Korravai with Durga, Seyon or Murugan with 

Kartikeya, and Vendan with Indra. The Sangam and post-Sangam 

poetry extending up to about the seventh century Speaks of 

temples—Kottams, Nagarams and  Koyils—dedicated to these 

gods, besides temples for Siva, Indra's mount—Airavata, and his 

thunderbolt Vajra, the celestial boon tree- Kalpataru, the Sun and 

the Moon. The beginnings of the slow evolution of Agamic wor- 

ship are also to be found here. Similar, but to a much lesser 

degree, was the effect in the case of local Jainism, which was 

mainly and for long Digambara, and Buddhism. Iconic forms of 

Siva, Vishnu, Surya, Kartikeya, Sri, Durga and other gods were 

also evolved. This synthesis, in effect, resulted, after due growth 

during the five succeeding centuries (between the eighth and the 

thirteenth), in the contribution of the south to the common 

heritage of India of unique forms and concepts, for example, the 

form and concept of Siva as Nataraja and Dakshinamurti, Devi as 

Lalita, the bhakti cult of the Nayanmars and Alvars—the Saiva 

and Vaishnava hagiologists—and the great philosophies of 

Advaita, Visishtadvaita and Dvaita of Sankara, Ramanuja and 

Madhva. The same can be said of the contributions of the south 

to Jainism and Buddhism of later times. 



No remains of these gods, mostly painted or carved in wood, or 

of their temples of brick-and-timber, have survived in the far 

south. This was because of the perishable nature of the fabric of 

which they were made. 



The northern half of the peninsula which comprises the Deccan 





THB BEGINNINGS—EARLY TEMPLES 19 





and the Andhra and Kannada areas, that is, roughly those parts 

that came under the. Mauryan empire, naturally imbibed more 

from the penetrating cultures, religions and languages (Prakrit and 





Sanskrit) than others, This resulted in the delayed development of 

its indigenous literatures which thus do not supply much material 

regarding the purcly local traditions and beliefs of the very carly 

times. But many contemporary material relics indicating the rcli- 

gious forms and places of worship are extant and have come up, 

as in north India, in the latest excavations. Though the Bud- 

dhist relics are more numerous, recent excavations in Nagar- 

junakonda have revealed the existence also of Hindu temples 

side by side, siowing the popularity of the Saivite, Vaishnavite, 

and other cults. These relics also reveal the fact that the 

temples or shrines had a c»mmon plan, design and mode of 

construction, irrespective of the creeds to which they belonged. 

The credal dilierence was marked only by the gods or objects 

that were installed for worship and their appropriate symbols 

or other plastic representations that formed the decorative 

elements of such temples. Jainism seems to havc had more 

congenial homes in the Kannada, Tamil and Kerala areas. In 

their plans their religious structures, particularly their temples, 

did not dilfer much from those of the Hindus, a feature that 

has persisted through the centuries to the present day. The 

traces of Buddhist temples that were perhaps fewer have been lost 

in these areas, though a number of Buddha images of later periods 

have been found in diíferent parts of south India. Had their tem- 

ples survived, they too would not have differed much in form 

from the Hindu or Jain temples of those days. 





Architecturally, these simple shrines, replicas of contemporary 

secular dwellings, were square, oblong, circular, elliptical and 

apsidal, rarely hexagonal or octagonal, and were built of timber 

or brick. Such religious and secular structures are indicated in the 

early bas-rclief sculptures belonging to the centuries immediately 

before and after Christ, e.g. Barhut and Sanchi in the north and 

Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda and other places in the south. 





20 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





They have already been indicated as being plans in the representa- 

tion of tree-temples or vriksha-chaityas, Buddhist stupas, and 

Bodhi-maridas (Podi-manram in Tamil). MD 



The square buildings have their roofs converging to a point 

(kuta), the circular or octagonal ones likewise have domical roofs 

(kuta), the oblong ones. have vault-like or wagon-top-like (sala) 

or occasionally gabled roofs (sabha), as in Sitamarhi and Sone 

Bhandar, and the elliptical ones have inverted keel-shaped roofs 

with a long ridge and a number of finials (also called sala). The 

front view of the apsidal structures can be noted in many of these 

relief sculptures. 



From the extant literary descriptions, from the sculptural repre- 

sentations in relief, and from the.few excavated relics (as, for 

example, the circular shrine at Bairat, others at Nagarjunakonda 

and Salihundam, and the standing ones in Chejerla and Ter in 

Andhra and western Deccan), one can infer that the roofs of 

these brick-and-timber structures were either supported on their 

pillars, the intervening spaces being covered by screen walls, or 

they were raised totally on their walls with the pillars, if any, 

‘represented only as ‘ornamental pilasters externally. Often the 

brick-wall had an internal system of pillars standing close to them 

to form additional supports for the beams and timbering of the 

superstructure and the roof. The entire structure was often built 

over a solid masonry platform or adhishthana. 



The apsidal Guntupalle chaitya (second century A.D.) is wholly 

brick-built. The entrance has brickwork jambs into which a 

wooden door-frame was fitted. The roof was evidently a vault 

made up of corbelled brickwork that was plastered and perhaps 

also cribbed inside with wooden ribs and cross pieces—on the ana- 

logy of an earlier rock-cut chaitya of the same plan. The remains of 

another chaitya noticed near Vidyadharapuram, near, Vijayawada 

are of like nature. A somewhat better preserved stupa-shrine or 

stupa-chaitya, where the central object of worship was the represen- 

tation of a stupa, has come up from the excavations at Salihundam 

(Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh). The circular chaitya is 





THE BEGINNINGS—EARLY TEMPLES 21 





brick-built. The massive wall has a stepped up base provided with 

a narrow vestibule for approach in front, resembling the antarala 

of later temples. Several subsidiary shrines of identical shape also 

exist there. 



In Nagarjunakonda and other Andhra Buddhist sites, the brick- 

built chaitya temples are associated with vikaras or monasteries, 

where they are often found as apsidal structures on either side of 

the passage behind the main vihara entrance, or are found in pairs 

in front of the major stupas or maha-chaityas, which were them- 

selves open or hypaethral temples, facing each other. Often one of 

them enshrines a stupa and is called stupa-chaitya. The other 

enshrines the feet or, later, figures of the Buddha, and is known as 

Buddha-chaitya. Independent apsidal chaityas or temples, the ear- 

liest- of that type, were also known in Nagarjunakonda. A circular 

structure too, that possibly enshrined a Buddha image, has been 

noticed in Nagarjunakonda. In a few other cases the shrines have 

a square plan. 



The excavations in Nagarjunakonda have also revealed large 

non-Buddhist teniple complexes of the Ikshvaku kings (third and 

fourth centuries A.D.) dedicated to Siva, Vishnu, Kartikeya and 

Devasena. They have mostly four-sided or apsidal garbha-grihas 

(sanctum) built over an elevated plinth with a large pillared man- 

dapa in front of them, a raised platform at the fore part of the 

mandapa indicating a ranga-mandapa, and often an ambulatory coürt 

round the mandapa. The whole is enclosed by a brick-wall with 

entrance on the frontiside (east or west) on the gopura pattern, 

with simpler additional entrances on the south and north sides. 

The pillars of the mandapa were made from Palnad limestone, 

rectangular in section, chamfered at the corners for some length 

from a point above the middle height of the shaft, and terminating 

again-in an apex of a rectangular section. On top is cut a wide 

rectangular notch for fitting the wooden beams, which were mostly 

longitudinal. Over the beams, the local vein schist slabs, called 

Macherla slabs, were laid, and this ceiling was, perhaps, covered 

over by a brick-and-mortar terrace. The apsidal shrines, sometimes 





“22 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





in pairs, are entirely brick-built. Only sometimes as in the Pushpa- 

bhadrasvami temple, the superstructure is supported by a parallel 

row of limestone pillars set inside the straight sides of the apse 

with similar pillars arranged in a semi-circle at the rear curved end, 

the pillars carrying longitudinal beams over the parallel sides and 

Short curved beams over the rear pillars. The intervening spaces 

between the pillars were walled up. In front of the shrines there is 

often a rectangular ardha-mandapa interposed between the shrine 

and the pillared maha-mandapa. The maha-mandapa in some cases 

is often extended laterally by one or more bays and, in some ins- 

tances, there were pillared cloisters (malikai or malika) inside the 

enclosure walls surrounding the court round the three sides of the 

maha-mandapa. The temple complexes have a single main shrine or 

sometimes more than one main Shrine. The single shrines are 

oblong, square or apsidal in plan. In cases with multiple shrines 

there are some examples with two shrines, both apsidal, and others 

having both rectangular and apsidal shrines. The walls of the tem- 

ples do not appear to have been adorned with much sculpture. 

While the mandapas had flat roofs, the shrine superstructures, 

Particularly of the apsidal ones, were gaja-prishtha, i.e. with form 

resembling the hind-quarters of an elephant. It cannot be said for 

certain whether the square and oblong shrines were vimana forms 

with the typical storeyed Superstructure as found in the later 

vimanas of the south. One cannot fail to notice from the remains 

of this extensive site a close similarity between the Buddhist and 

non-Buddhist types in architectural traditions. 



The Kartikeyasvami temple had a square brick-built shrine 

facing east with a closed rectangular ardha-mandapa of bricks in 

front. Its longer axis north-south was preceded bya closed maha- 

mandapa with six rows of five pillars each. Another temple of 

Kartikeya, to the north of the Pushpabhadra temple, had a rectang- 

ular closed mandapa with a sguare pedestal close to its hind wall 

at its centre, and 2 pillar at each corner. It suggested a pillared 

mandapa shrine. The image in the Pushpabhadrasvami temple, 



eferred to by that name in the inscription on the dvajasthamba as 





THE BEGINNINGS—EARLY TEMPLES 23 





*Mahadeva Pushpabhadrasvamin', was enshrined in an apsidal 

garbha-griha. 



The icon of Ashtabhujasvamin, according to the inscription relat- 

ing to its installation, dated A.D. 278 was of wood, eight-armed, 

and was installed on a stone pedestal that carried the inscription. 

The inscription on a conch (sankha) found at the same site also 

bears the same name. The temple with its two sanctuaries, one 

Oblong and the other apsidal, each with a pillared mandapa in 

front distinct from the independent one of larger dimensions at 

the rear, had a dvajasthamba surmounted by the chakra emblem of 

Vishnu. 



The east-facing temple complex on the river bank and close to 

the village of Putlagudem, near the old ferry ghat, is interesting, 

in that in the court on the south and north sides of the pillared 

maha-mandapa were found the basements of pariyara shrines, all 

brick-built and topped by thin stone slabs forming the floors of the 

subsidiary shrines of sguare, circular, and octagonal plans. 



Similar brick temples of the post-Ikshvaku and pre-Chalukyan 

(sixth century) period, have been excavated in the submersible 

Srisailam project area in Vivapuram, Rungapur, Gumakonda, 

Kudavelli and Siddesvaram, all in the Kurnool and Mahboobnagar 

districts. The shrines are invariably square on plan with or without 

an attached ardha-mandapa in front. The lingas are of rolled natu- 

ral sandstone pebbles with or without linga-pithas. The spout of the 

latter where present is oriented north. Otherwise the consecrated 

image alone appears to be of stone, while the construction was of 

brick-and-timber. The soles (adhishthana) are of moulded bricks 

and moulded, parts of the superstructures too have come out in 

the excavations (Dr. R. Subrahmanyam and Dr. I. K. Sharma). 



Fortunately there are two apsidal shrines of this period: of 

original Buddhist dedication and subsequent conversion to the 

Hindu creed, still existing in their entirety. They are the Trivi- 

krama temple at Ter in western Deccan, and the Kapotesvara 

temple at Chejerla, in coastal Andhra. Both are dated earlier than 

A.D. 600, but not earlier than A.D. 300. Of the two, the Kapotesvara 





24 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





may be the earlier one judged from the stylistic and architectural 

points of view. This temple built of large-sized bricks shows no 

external pilaster markings on its wall, except at the two front ends 

which are not original. Internally the ceiling of stone slabs is 

supported by a system of ten stone pillars, ranged five each along 

the straight sides of the apsidal structure and spanned by thick 

stone beams, in contrast to the Nagarjunakonda structures which 

had wooden beams, thus marking an advance in the use of stone 

in construction and thereby indicating a later date. The vaulted 

brickwork sikhara is supported inside by uprights of either brick- 

work or stone and, perhaps, also by fillings in between over the 

ceiling slabs. The cornice moulding (kapora) and the clerestory-like 

griva as well as the blunted ridge of the sikhara shows a backward 

slope. i 



Recent excavations have revealed that the original foundation of. 

this temple was Saivite and not Buddhist, later converted into 

Saivite, as was hitherto believed. 



The Ter temple now containing a Trivikrama image shows more 

advanced features. It is entirely brick-built, without internal pillars 

or ceiling slabs, and the sikhara ridge is quite horizontal. Exter- 

nally the wall surface is relieved by pilasters with evolved capital 

components. Internally the vault is formed by a system of corbel- 

ling-in of the successive courses of brickwork from all sides, thus 

gradually diminishing the gap and ultimately closing it on top. This 

mode is called kadalika karana in Indian Silpa parlance. The front 

end of the sikhara of the Ter chaitya shows the barge-board and 

barge-plate with a median transverse supported on -four pilasters, 

and a centrallight-opening, all in imitation of timber orginals, 



“while the Chejerla sikhara facade shows the relief of a shrine. In 

these respects, these approximate to the motifs of the sikhara 

facades of the Visvakarma at Ellora and the Nakula-Sahadeva 

Ratha in Mamallapuram. 





CHAPTER III 





EARLY ROCK ARCHITECTURE 





ROCK-CUT CAVE-TEMPLES—LAYANAS (BUDDHIST) 





SIDE BY side with the Predominantly brick-and-timber architecture 

of early times, there arose a movement at the time of Asoka which 

resulted in a series of temples and other religious resorts being ex- 

cavated into living rock. Being made of more permanent material, 

these have survived to the present day. Since they are faithful 

imitations of the contemporary brick-and-timber structures which 

Served as their models, they reproduced, at least in their frontal 

and interior aspects, all the architectural details of the period, thus 

enabling us to form an idea of what the fronts and interiors of 

contemporary temples and places of worship were like. This phase 

of excavating, what are called layanas into rock and creating 

partial or total imitations of Structural examples cannot be called 

architecture, which essentially implies construction by building up 

of components. They can only be regarded as sculpture on a large 

scale, more Conveniently designated as ‘rock architecture’, or 

‘architectural Sculpture’. The phase of rock architecture. extended 

approximately over a period of More than a thousand years from 

‘the time of Asoka, and is found scattered over different parts of 

India, the latest of them belonging to the close of the tenth 

century. 



The earliest caves excavated by Asoka and his grandson Dasaratha 

into the very hard local rock (quartzose-gneiss) are in the Barabar 

and Nagarjuni hills near Gaya. They were dedicated to the Ajivi- 

kas. The most important examples of this group are the Sudama 

XNyagrodha) and the Lomas Rishi caves. These two caves exactly 

reproduce the plan of the Suddhamma Deva Sabha in the Barhut 





26 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





relief. This series of caves indicates that the simplest form of such 

temples consisted of a circular cell or shrine alone, as at Guntu- 

palle (see below); the porch, or mandapa was added laterto 

accommodate worshippers. This mode of rock architecture shifted 

In the next century mainly to the softer trap formations of the hills 

of western India or western Deccan where, between 200 в.с. and 

A.D. 200, a number of Buddhist excavations were made. They in- 

clude chaitya halls, which were really temples or places of worship, 

the object of worship being a stupa representing the Buddha, апа 

viharas, or monasteries, each with a number of cells opening into a 

large central assembly-hall. Such examples are found in the vicinity 

of Poona and Nasik, and at Ajanta and Aurangabad. The choice of 

this area was due to the fact that the softer trap rocks were more 

easy to work on than the hard granites or gneisses, as in Gaya. 

Such places of worship were also excavated into the softer rocks on 

the Eastern Ghats, lying in the northern coastal districts of Andhra 

and the southern districts of Orissa, as in Guntupalle and San- 

karam, both cut-in and cut-out, the examples in Orissa being the 

Jain caves of Khandagiri and Udayagiri. Among these the Bud- 

dhist cave at Kondivte in Salsette, the Tulaja cave in Junnar, near 

Poona, and the cave in Guntupalle in Andhra bear comparison 

with the Sudama and Lomas Rishi caves near Gaya. 



Beyond the Bombay-Poona region, where the soft trap rock 

formations were exploited for excavation of chaityas and viharas, 

further north and north-west, the laterite hills as in Junagad, 

afforded the venue for such excavations; laterite when freshly 

exposed being equally soft and tractable. Further south, beyond 

Konkan, in the Kerala area, west of the ghats, again abounding in 

Jaterite, it was excavated into, though as cave-tombs of megalithic 

association in corresponding times. 



The rock-cut chaitya at Guntupalle is not far removed from the 

Gaya caves in point of time. It is a stone yersion of a circular hut 

with a cupola-like domed roof of thatch or sheet metal resting on 

a wooden frame-work resembling an inverted basket, and enshrin- 

ing а monolithic stupa as the object of worship in the centre, а 





EARLY ROCK ARCHITECTURE 27 





circumambulatory passage all round, and a porch in front of its 

doorway. The porch framing the entrance shows similar imitation 

of timberwork in stone, including the torana arch above the lintel. 



The Buddhist cave-temple in Kondivte is of similar design where 

the circular shrine or garbha-griha is occupied by a solid stupa 

leaving only a narrow circumambulatory passage or pradakshina 

all round within the shrine and occupying the end of a rectangular 

hall or mandapa, with a flat roof as the shrine itself. The Tulaja 

cave in Junnar is also an excavation after the model of a circular 

chaitya. The main roofing dome rests on a ring of twelve plain 

octagonal pillars, instead of on a circular wall—as in the other 

examples —enclosing a central stupa, both surrounded by a 

circular aisle, or pradakshina, which is. half-domed.! The circular 

garbha-griha of the Suddhamma Deva Sabha in Barhut is a bas- 

relief representation of the same model. 



The other chaityas are mainly apsidalin plan, consisting of a 

long rectangular hall like a nave, terminating at the farther end 

into an apse with often two narrower aisles on either side, each 

separated from the nave by a row of pillars and extended round 

the apse as a circumambulatory passage round a stupa, also hewn 

out of rock and occupying the centre of the apse. The doorway in 

front is a huge threshold with an arched window on top. In front 

of the facade of the hall, a transverse verandah with frontal pillars 

is often cut. The structures after which such excavations were made 

were, therefore, essentially apsidal temples. Such an apsidal or 

chapa form resulted perhaps from the coming together of a circular 

shrine and a rectangular assembly-hall, which were originally dis- 

tinct from each other as in the examples already described. 



At Ajanta, in the Deccan, out of the thirty excavations, six con- 

sisting of two chaitya halls (Nos..9 and 10), and four viharas (Nos. 

8, 12, 13 and 30), belong to the early group, and are of the same 

type as some Buddhist excavations at Bhaja, Karle, Kondane, 





—— 





1A temple of a similar structural plan has come to light in the excavations at 

Bairat, near Jaipur. 





28 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Pithalkora, Nasik, Kanheri, etc. These belong to the period bet- 

ween the second century В.С. and the second century A.D. The rest 

belong to the period after the fourth century A.D. They were ex- 

cavated in the time of the Vakatakas, mostly between A.D. 450 and 

600. The last ones were excavated around A.D. 650. The activity in 

general, and particularly the embellishments, however, continued 

till the times of the Rashtrakutas in the eighth-ninth centuries A.D. 



The early chaityas are large, apsidal, with an elaborate facade, 

having horse-shoe-shaped windows on the top of the entrance, and 

the interior divided into a central nave and lateral aisles by two 

rows of columns. The aisles continued round the apse as a circum- 

ambulatory passage. À rock-cut sfupa, in the apse portion, formed 

the object of worship. The ceilings of the aisles were either flat or 

vaulted, the whole modelled after timber constructions. 



Thc viharas were astylar halls, with a number of monk's cells 

excavated into their three side walls, the hall having one or more 

main entrances in front. 



The rock architecture of the second phase consists of two apsidal 

chaityas (19 and 26). It is similar to the earlier type but has a 

Buddha figure prominently standing out in front of the stupa in 

the apse, under a nasika or arch projected from the drum of the 

stupa. This suggests that the form of the stupa itself was conceived 

as a circular shrine with a domical roof, and a projected vaulted 

entrance porch in front in the shape of a sukhanasika, conforming 

to the vesara type of temples of later periods." The viharas, except 

those unfinished or destroyed (3, 5, 14, 23, 24, 28 and 29), combine ' 

the characteristics of monasteries and shrines in them, the latter 

aspect becoming more prominent. Thus these abodes of stone, or 

hill-abodes, called Sailagriha in an inscription datable between A.D. : 

450 and 525 in Cave 26, would become vihara-chaityas, if we eguats 

the term chaitya with the shrine containing an object of worship, 

called also devakula, ayatana, vimana, dhama, mandira, etc. In fact,- 

the inscription in vihara 16, datable between A.D. 475 and 500, — 





p would bear comparison with the similar and smaller Nalanda brick 

stupas. ; 





BARLY ROCK ARCHITECTURE 29 





calls it a chaitya-mandira. ` 



These viharas generally consist of an outer verandah or porch, 

corresponding to the mukha-mandapa or agra-mandapa of the 

temple complexes, a pillared hall (sometimes astylar), correspond- 

ing to the maha-mandapa with a shrine or garbha-griha at its rear, 

often with an ardha-mandapa, or transversely rectangular ante- 

chamber intervening between the shrine and the main hall. When 

the. hall has pillars instead of a central nave and lateral aisles 

pattern, the arrangement of a central square enclosed by four or 

more pillars—the others forming a peripheral series—would suggest 

a ranga-mandapa on the model of or anticipating the Chalukyan 

navarangas. Into the lateral walls of the maha-mandapa ог hall and 

sometimes also into the hind walls cubical cells are cut for the 

priestly monks. These are fewer in number than those in regular 

monasteries—rock-cut and brick-built—thus suggesting that their 

use was restricted to the monks of higher ranks only, or to the 

priestly order immediately connected with the actual ritual worship 

in the principal chaitya. Often there are additional Chaityas or cells 

on ejther side of the principal one on the rear wall of the hall, and 

- also in the lateral walls of the front porch, or agra-mandapa. Even 

tbe two-storeyed excavation (Cave 6) has essentially the same plan. 

The sanctum contains а large figure of the Buddha, often with 

other sculptures in the ardha-mandapa. In the case of Cave 27, the 

ardha-mandapa is advanced into the maha-mandapa. The arrange- 

ment of a succession of mandapas, one behind the other, with one 

or more shrine cells at the rear, is on the pattern found in the brick- 

temple complexes of the Ikshvaku period in Nagarjunakonda that 

preceded these later excavations in Ajanta. 



The hindmost part of such an axial group—consisting of the 

rectangular ante-chamber and square sanctum behind it, some- 

times partly advanced into it—is found repeated mostly as the plan 

in the Hindu and Jain rock-cut cave-temples of the Chalukyas, 

Pallavas, Pandyas and other dynasties of south India, who con- 

tinued rock-cut architecture from the sixth to about the first half 

of the tenth century A.D. or even later, as in Ellora. In a few cases, 





30 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





as in the Ajanta examples, the cave-temple has a large and almost 

square. mandapa, corresponding to the hall with the sanctum 

behind, the transverse rectangular ardha-mandapa being eliminated. : 

In a temple complex with such an axial arrangement, the sanctum 

does not appear to have had a superstructure of the pyramidal 

type. These cave temples, including the chaitya-mandiras, may as 

well be called mandapa-temples as they are designated in later 

inscriptions. The excavation of lateral shrines on either side of the 

. main shrine all in a line, with a common mandapa in front, is one 

line of elaboration, while the other line would be the excavation of 

additional shrines into the lateral walls with all the shrines opening 

into a common hall or verandah as is often found in the verandahs 

or ante-chambers of the Ajanta viharas. Both the modes are found 

developed in the later cave-temples of the Chalukyas, Pallavas, 

Pandyas, and other contemporary dynasties of the south. 



The Buddhist rock architecture of Ellora (in all twelve excava- 

tions) concentrated at the south end of the hill, as also the excava- 

tions at Aurangabad mark the culmination of the series, and they 

continüe the earlier tradition of western India. 



The Ellora Buddhist group falls into three sub-groups, the 

earliest being Caves 1, 2, 3 and 5, dating from round about the 



- fourth century A.D. Caves 4 and from 6 to 10 are assignable to the 

sixth-seventh centuries A.D. Caves 1l and 12, which are unique, 

belong to the seventh century A.D. In contrast Caye 1 in. the first 

series is simple and perhaps an experimental excavation. Caves 2 

and 3 are essentially similar to each other. They have a verandah 

or agra-mandapa, with a'door behind leading into a pillared hall 

and an ardha-mandapa. While the maha-mandapa- of Cave 2 has 

lateral galleries on either side, that of Cave 3 is without them. 

The shrine cells behind both contain a seated Buddha. The shrine 

of Cave 2 has two lateral cells with an ante-chamber or ardha- 

mandapa. There are monastic cells on the lateral walls of the 

mandapa of Cave 3. Cave 6, the largest among single-storeyed 

excavations, consists of a verandah and a pillared hall with 22 cells 

on its walls. Behind the pillared maha-mandapa is a transverse 





EARLY ROCK ARCHITECTURE 31 





ante-chamber or ardha-mandopa, with a Buddha shrine in the rear. 



Cave 4 is two-storeyed. The ground floor consists of a hall, an 

ante-chamber and a shrine behind, with additional cells on either 

side of the shrine and on the lateral walls of the hall. The upper 

floor is ruined and a pradakshina-patha and two , cells alone аге 

extant. Cave 8 has again a large hall with three monk-cells on the 

north wall. The shrine behind, fully cut out, “hasa pradakshina- 

patha, and an ante-chamber in front. It contains.a seated Buddha, 

On the north wall of the pradakshina-patha there are monastic 

cells. 



Cave 6 as usual has a verandah and a hall bchind, having a 

lateral hall on the south with six-cells. At the rear of the main hall 

there are an ante-chamber and the shrine. Cave 7 has behind its 

verandah a hall with four central pillars and twelve unfinished cells - 

on its three side walls. The central shrine at the rear is flanked on 

one side by a Prajnaparamita and its door-frame is moulded, thus 

denoting that it is the main shrine. 



Cave 9, strictly speaking, is a long hall or mandapa, with a. pro- 

minent sculptured facade—a poor imitation of Cave I0. The back 

wall is divided into three bays Бу. four pilasters, the central bay 

containing a sculpture of the seated Buddha simulating a shrine, 

while the lateral bays contain attendants. . 



Cave 10 (Visvakarma) is a large chaitya similar to those at 

Ajanta with pillars and aisles and balconies in front of the arch: 

opening. The pillars are simple and the sculptures few. The-apse 

consists of a siza with a shrine of the seated Buddha cut into it, 

thus indicating the stupa form to be a circular vimana (vesara) with 

the deity inside. The drum of the stupa has twelve panels all round, 

ten of which contain miniature Buddhas. The arch on the facade is 

very elaborate and different in design from that found in Ajanta 

and elsewhere. Its trefoil arches, and the udgamas and the amala- 



. kas; recall similar motifs characteristic of contemporary and later 

Brahmanical temples in the northern style. 



Caves 11 and 12 of the seventh century A.D., called ‘Do-tal’ 



and “Tin-tal', respectively, are perhaps the largest of this class of 





32 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Buddhist excavation, remarkably original in their plans and storeys, 

containing interesting iconographic sculptures and architectural 

embellishments. Though both are three-storeyed, the “Do-tal’ cave 

was so called since its ground floor remained buried. A similar 

rock-cut cave excavation, now called Anantasayanagudi in Unda- 

valli on the south bank of the Krishna, also belongs to this class. 

It is perhaps of the Vishnu-kundin times and was meant originally 

for a Buddhist dedication. 



The Aurangabad cave-temples include a chaitya of the earlier 

„Ніпауапа phase and a number of viharas (eight in two groups) and 

other less important excavations, all belonging to the seventh 

century A.D. 



In all these excavations the roughness of the texture even of 

finished surfaces necessitated a plaster coating to render it smooth. 

Further embellishments came by way of rich paintings of which 

we have many extant as the celebrated paintings of Ajanta. 





CHAPTER IV 

LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 





` ROCK-CUT CAVE-TEMPLES—LAYANAS 

(HINDU AND JAIN) 





IN THE beginning of the second half of the millennium after Christ, 

the Brahmanical and Jain creeds too started adopting the rock-cut 

mode of temples. This caught on quickly and in the last four cen- 

turies of the millennium a vast number of such temples had been 

created all over the south, from the Deccan to very near the Cape. 

These, incidentally, are far more numerous than similar excavatioris 

in the north. The majority of these again are Brahmanical. The 

Jain ones are fewer. The inauguration of this mode of rock-cut 

temples for the Brahmanical and Jain gods commenced with the. 

coming to power of three great empires. in the peninsula—the 

Chalukyas of Vatapi (Badami) in the Deccan region, with their 

collateral branch of the Chalukyas of Vengi (or the Eastern Chalu- 

kyas) on coastal Andhra, the Pallavas of Kanchi on the eastern 

coast, and the Pandyas of Madurai in the far south. The best and 

maximum output in this direction came during the three centuries 

between A.D. 550 and 850,- when these three powerful kingdoms 

were not only keen political rivals but were also close competitors 

in the patronage of art, architecture and literature. While the early 

Chalukyas of Badami were replaced in the middle of this period 

by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, the Pallavas and the Pandyas 

continued ‘to hold sway. right through: The intervening minor and 

‘subordinate dynasties, wedged among the three imperial powers as 

buffer states, also took part in the activity and contributed to this 

movement in their respective regions. 



There had been 2 lingering tradition of a taboo on stone for 





34 | TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





sacred and secular structures, because of its long local association 

with funerary erections, as has been noted before. This was appar- 

ently broken almost simultaneously by the Chalukya King 

Mangalesa, and his contemporary the Pallava King, Mahendra I. 

Mangalesa excavated Vishnu Cave-temple No. III in Badami, in 

commemoration of and in association with the Narayana-bali: 

ceremony (shraddha) of his departed and beloved brother Kirti- 

varman in Saka 500 (A.D. 578), as the related inscriptions say. 

Mahendra I, perhaps taking the cue, excavated his first cave-temple 

at Mandagapattu (south Arcot district) for the Hindu trinity— 

Siva, Vishnu and Brahma. While Mangalesa chose the finely- 

grained and horizontally stratified soft sandstone cliffs of Badami 

(Bijapur district), the new capital, Mahendra I chose the very hard 

close-grained granite rock of Mandagapattu, far away from his 

capital. In Mangalesa’s case, though the excavation of a cavé- 

temple for a Hindu god and the carving of Hindu sculptures on it 

were altogether novel credal innovations, the mode was -only a 

perpetuation of the earlier tradition of excavating such cave-temples 

into deliberately chosen soft rocks like sandstone, trap or lime- 



. stone that had been in continuous existence from Mauryan times 

in north, central and western India as also the Deccan.’ Thus, 

his craftsmen had the advantage of the long acquired know-how 

of such cutting into sandstones and carving them, which had been 

developing for nearly a millennium. The first cave-temple was, as 

a result, bold and: ambitious in design and of larger dimensions. 

Close on Mangalesa's first cave-temple followed other similar cave- 

temples of the Chalukyas in Badami, Aihole, and other places, all 

excavated into the same soft rocks. 



In the case of Mahendra, the excavation into hard rock and 

carving of the cave-temple and sculpture would almost be an inno- 

vation; since there had been no precedents, except those of Asoka 

and Dasaratha in the Barabar, Nagarjuni „and Sitamarhi hills, 

near Gaya, some nine hundred years before. Since then the practice 





—————— - . а 

“1 Jn fact, the Guptas had earlier excavated cave-temples for the Hindu gods 

in the sandstone cliffs of Udaigirj near Vidisa. 





` 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 35 





and tradition had been totally given up or forgotten: and not 



attempted in that long interval of-time and space. In such a con- 



text, Mahendra’s gloating over bis first achievement in his inscrip- 

tion on the Mandagapattu cave-temple became quite meaningful. - 

The inscription states that “this brickless, timberless, metalless 

and mortarless abode of Lakshita was caused to be made by King 

Vichitrachitta for Brahma, Isvara and Vishnu.” The small inscrip- 

tion is important also in that Mahendra’s work was a departure 

from the contemporary usage and tradition in the: matter of the 

creation of a stone-temple without resorting to the usual materials, 

such as brick, timber, metal and mortar. What was even more 

significant was that it was a departure from the process known 

till then of excavating into deliberately chosen soft rocks. This 



was followed by more cave-temples being excavated by him into 



the hard rocks of the south. They are all of a simpler design and 

less ambitious in size, because of the hardness of the new rock 

material of hitherto unknown potentialities that involved greater 

labour, invention of new tools and skills in cutting, and longer 

time to complete. 



Thus one may say that the Chalukyas and the Pallavas inaug- 

urated two parallel traditions in the south. The succeeding dynasties 

in the Chalukyan region of the Deccan, north Mysore, and coast- 

al Andhra continued the choice and use of soft stone rocks for 

their cave-temples and later for their structural temples. Those that 

came after the Pallavas and their contemporary Pandyas, who also 

excavated into hard rocks of their area, continued to choose and 

employ likewise hard rocks for their rock-cut and structural 

temples further south. 



The result was that these two parallel traditions continued in the 

south in the respective regions till the advent of the Vijayanagar 

Empire in the second half of the fourteenth century, which soon 

embraced in its ambit both these regions and in fact soon extend- 

ed practically over the whole of south India. The soft stone tradi- 

tion of the northern region almost came to an end and the use of 

hard “stone for temple construction became almost universal, 





36 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





though the regional styles and distinguishing characters that had 

developed up to that time in either region were generally maintained. 



The three centuries covering the rock-cut phase in the Brahman- 

ical and Jain temple architecture coincided also with the great 

revivalist movements of the Hindus and the continuing hold of the 

Jain sects on some sections of the people. With the commencement 

of the seventh century, and in the wake of the revivalist move- 

ments of the Hindus, great changes were wrought and the bhakti 

cult developed. In the Tamil land the Saiva and Vaishnava hymnist 

saints, the Nayanmars and the Alvars became wedded to the Vedic 

traditions and traversed the whole area visiting shrines, singing 

hundreds of devotional hymns in Tamil and rousing the people. 

This also resulted in the reformation of the extremist Saiva creeds 

of the Kalamukhas, Pasupatas, Mahesvaras, Saktas and the like, it 

curbed the strong hold that Jainism had on the people and, almost 

led to the decline of Buddhism. 



Jainism had all along been having a great hold on the Telugu and 

Kannada regions as a result of the patronage it received from the 

kings and the rich mercantile groups. The Kannada area continued 





` to be the centre of south Indian Jainism from where the various 





guchchhas. branched out into the Tamil and Telugu areas. It was 

again in the first half of the ninth century that the great Hindu 

reformer-philosopher, Sankaracharya, appeared on the scene, re- 

fined the existing creeds and their practices, established the six 

malas (the Shanmata, viz. Ganapatya Kaumara, Saura, Saiva, 

Vaishnaya, and Sakta) on a sound basis, and propounded the great 

and universal philosophy of Advaita. It is a curious fact that these 





“Tock-cut or stone-built temples of the period, though created by 





great kings or with their patronage, were almost totally ignored by 

the contemporary Tamil hymnists. This was perhaps because they 

were innovations that avoided the use of traditional materials of 

architecture and sculpture and as such militated against the sam- 

pradaya. Evidently, it took them time to become acceptable. 



The output in terms of rock-cut temples of the Pallavas and 

after them the contemporary Pandyas and minor dynasties like the 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 31 





Muttaraiyars of the Thanjavur region in between, and of the rulers 

in the Kerala area is far greater in hard rock than it is in softer 

rocks of the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Eastern Chalukyas 

and the Telugu Chodas of the Deccan and coastal Andhra areas. 

The Pallava cave-temples form a more coherent series and as such 

can be considered first. 





THE PALLAVA: MAHENDRA STYLE CAVE-TEMPLES 





The simple cave-temples of Mahendra (c. A.D. 580-630) consist 

of a pillared verandah with shrine-cell or cells cut into either the 

rear or the side walls of the verandah or hall, depending on which 

way the main facade of the verandah or mandapa faced. Thus in 

mandapas facing south or north, the single shrine-cell or cells were 

often cut into the lateral walls so as to face cast or west, while in 

mandapas facing east or west, the shrine-cell or cells were cut into 

the hind wall of the mandapa. These, as all rock-cut architecture, 

are necessarily designed to show the interior aspect of the struc- 

tural monuments they imitated. They are essentially of the mandapa- 

type of temples. The cave-temples excavated by Mahendra are 

authenticated by his own inscriptions which are very often single 

dedicatory verses or string of his titles. Such temples are ten in. 

number. Nine of them are: the Lakshitayatana dedicated to the 

Trimurti at Mandagapattu, the so-called Pancha Pandava cave- 

temple at Pallavaram (now converted into a Muslim dargah), the 

Rudravalisvaram, or Cave-temple No. II at Mamandur dedicated 

to Siva, the Kal-mandapám cave-temple at Kuranganilmuttam, 

very similar to the Pallavaram cave-temple though unfinished and 

without Pallava inscriptions, the Vasantesvara or larger cave-tem- 

ple at Vallam, dedicated to Siva, 'the Mahendra-Vishnu-griha cave- 

temple at Mahendravadi, the Vishnu cave-temple or Cave-temple 

No. I at Mamandur, the Satrumallesvaralaya cave-temple at Dala- 

vanur dedicated to Siva, and the Avanibhajana Pallavesvara-griha ` 

cave-temple at Siyamangalam. All of them are located round about 





1 

38 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





the Pallava capital of Kanchi and the port town of Mahabalipuram 

(Mamallapuram) in the Chingleput, north Arcot, and south Arcot 

districts—comprising the Pallava home province of Tondaiman- 

dalam (the region situated to the north, west and south of modern 

Madras). The Lalitankura Pallavesvara-griha, or the upper rock- 

cut cave-temple at, Tiruchirapalli, is the solitary one farthest from 

the capital, situated in the Chola mandalam on the bank of the 

Kaveri up to which boundary Mahendravarman inherited: the 

kingdom from his father, Simha Vishnu. This cave-temple is also 

the only example excavated near the summit of the hill,while the 

rest are nearer to the base of the rocks. The unfinished rock-cut 

temples at Vilappakkam (north Arcot district) and Aragandanal- 

lur (south Arcot district) would also, on stylistic grounds, belong 

to the Mahendra style. 



Where there is. only a single cell behind the mandapa, there are 





four pillars and pilasters on the facade of the rectangular mandapa, 

two pilasters in antis at the two extreme ends against the side 

walls, and two pillars in the middle—all equally spaced. The facade 

is longer with four, six or eight equally-spaced pillars between the 

extreme pilasters and with three, five, or seven shrine-cells. The 

pillars are all massive, short, square in section at the base and top, 

with the middle third of the height octagonal in section. They carry 

massive corbels with bevelled. or curved ends, sometimes with the 

faces carved as a series of rolls, the taranga, with a median flat 

band, the patta. A massive beam is cut above the corbels, but 

there is no well-formed cornice projection, or kapota, the rough 

rock brow itself. acting as one. The faces of the square sections of 

the pillars are adorned with large circular lotus medallions often 

inscribed inside a square. The mandapa may be divided by an inner 

longitudinal row of pillars and pilasters into two sections, front 

and rear, indicating the mukha-mandapa and ardha-mandapa por- 

tions, though both may be of the same width and of the same type, 

corresponding to the facade row. Where there are no inner pillars, 

the differentiation is indicated by the varying floor-levels or. ceiling 

heights. 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 39

A flight of about three rock-cut steps from the floor of the man- 

dapa leads to the simple shrine-entrance which is cut projecting a 

little into the mandapa. The shrine often shows a moulded pedestal, 

or adhishthana, and the wall'is cantoned at its two front corners 

by four-sided flat pilasters with two more in between, each of the 

inner pairs flanking the shrine entrance. Often these two inner 

pilasters form also the two jambs of the simple doorway with a 

low lintel across and.a sill eut at the top of the flight of steps 

below. The door-frame, if distinct, is again simple and unadorned. 

The pilasters carry in some cases distinct capital mouldings and/ 

corbels, or potika, on top. A beam and flexed overhanging vornice 

or kapota is cut on top. The kapota is adorned by semi-circular 

kudu ornaments, with a flat shovel-shaped finial above. 



The shrine doors are generally guarded by relief sculptures of 

two armed drarapalas, or gatekeepers, one on each side. In the 

earliest cave-temple where the shrines for the trinity—Brahma, Siva 

and Vishnu—are but deep plain niches cut into the rear wall, the 

two dyarapalas are found one on either side of the facade of the 

mandapa. The Vasantesvaram at Vallam, the Vishnu cave-temple 

of Mahendravadi and Mamandur and the Avanibhajanas cave- 

temple at Siyamangalam are examples of cave-temples with a 

single shrine-cell cut into the hind wall of the mandapa. The Rudra- 

valisvaram of Mamandur and the Kalmandakam cave-temple at 

Kuranganilmuttam are examples with three shrine-cells, as at 

Mandagapattu. The four additional cells, two on each lateral wall 

of the ardha- and mukha-mandapas of the Kalmandakam temple, 

are later additions to the original scheme of three cells on the rear 

wall. The Pallavaram cave-temple has five shrine-cells, while the . 

unfinished Vilappakkam cave-temple has seven shrine-cells. The 

similar unfinished Aragandanallur cave-temple, with four pillars 

and two pilasters on the facade and in the hind row, would indi- 





cate five shrine-cells on the rear wall still uncut. Thus the number 

and disposition of shrines on the rear wall would correspond to 





the pillars of the mandapa in front, each shrine-opening coming in 

between two equally-spaced pillars, or à pillar and a pilaster. This 





40 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





along with the equal inter-columniation would contrast with the 

. arrangement of the wider central nave and the narrower lateral 

aisles of the earlier Buddhist examples followed by the contempo- 

rary and later examples of the Chalukya-Rashtrakuta series. 



The facades as well as the shrines of the Kalmandakam, Rudra- 

valisvaram, Vasantesvaram and the Vishnu cave-temples of 

Mahendravadi and Mamandur face almost ‘east, while those at $ 

Mandagapattu, Vilappakkam and Siyamangalam face almost west. 

Pallayaram is the only example in the series where the mandapa 

facade and shrine-cells face south: The Lalitankura and Satru- 

malla cave-temples at Tiruchirapalli and Dalavanur are examples 

with the mandapa facing south and the shrine cut into the lateral 

wall—the eastern one at Tiruchirapalli and the western one at 

Dalavanur—so that the shrines face west and east respectively. In : 

the Dalavanur cave-temple the larger mandapa, with a single row 



of pillars and pilaster on the facade, indicates an inner division 

of the front and rear portions of the mandapa by a difference in 

the floor levels. The shrine on the western wall of the ardha-man- 

dapa part is cut with a small porch-like pillared mandapa in front 

of it. This too is rock-cut and stands on the floor of the ardha- 

mandapa on a distinct plinth at a still higher level. In the case of 

the Tiruchirapalli cave-temple, an inner row of pillars and pilasters 

is cut very close to the hind wall with a narrow passage in between 

it and the wall. The cell on the east faces west into the front part 

of the mandapa between the inner and outer rows of columns. 

This is a feature not quite Pallava, but rather reminiscent of the 

cave-temples in the Pandyan country, for example, the one at 

Tirupparankunram. Incidentally, the Lalitankura Pallavesvaram 

cave-temple of Tiruchirapalli is the southernmost Pallava cave- 

temple nearer to the borders of the Pandya territory. The lotus 

medallions. on the top and bottom cubical parts (sadurams) of the 

pillars, which are absent in the earlier cave-temples of this series 

like those at Mandagapattu, Pallavaram and Kuranganilmuttam, 

and the Siva caves at Mamandur and Vallam, are to be found in 

the later ones of the series as in the Vishnu cave-temples at 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 41 





Mahendravadi and Mamandur. The Siva cave-temples at Tiruchira- 

palli and Siyamangalam have, in addition, other motifs incised in- 

side circular medallions, such as makaras, kinnaris, matanganakras 

(combination of an elephant and a makara), and pushpa-lata 

and patra-lata (scrolls of leaves and flowers). The Siyamangalam 

cave-temple has small relief panels of Sculpture on top of the 

pilasters. \ 



The shrine-cells, ог garbha-griha, in all these cases are empty 

and do not contain either a rock-cut linga or linga-pitha, as-is 

common in the Pandya, Muttaraiyar and Chalukyan cave-temples. 

They do not have in fact any appropriate sculpture of the deity in 

worship —Siva, Vishnu or other gods—to whom the temple accord- 

ing to the inscription is known to be dedicated. Often there are 

traces of lime plaster with a painting over it on the hind wall indi- 

cating that the object of worship was a mural painting of the god. 

Sometimes one finds a slight relief of a pedestal cut at the base of 

the hind wall indicating that the deity was done in stucco, or lime 

mortar and painted, or was a wooden panel with a carving set 

into a sunk chase on the wall. 



These Mahendra temples are noted also for the absence of other 

kinds of sculpture even in the mandapa part, except those of the 

dvarapalas. These dvarapalas are found at either end of the facade 

of the mandapa in the Mandagapattu cave-temple. In the Dalavanur 



and Siyamangalam cave-temples, the dvarapalas are found not only ' 

on either side of the mandapa facade but also on either side of the 

shrine-entrance inside. In the rest of'the series, these are found 

only on either side of the shrine-entrance. In the case of the Vishnu 

cave at Mamandur and the cave-temple at Pallavaram, there are 

dyarapalas neither on the flanks of the mandapa facade nor on the 

flanks of the shrine-cells. The dvarapalas either face full-front or 

are in semi-profile or half-turned towards the shrine-door and 

stand resting on a massive club entwined by a serpent. In Siya- 

: mangalam the two outer dvarapalas are, however, depicted as 

warriors inside separate niches at either end of the mandapa facade, 

while the two flanking the shrine-entrance are of the usual form. 





42 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA - 





The Tiruchirapali upper rock-cut cave-temple of Lalitankura is 

unique in thatit has a large group sculpture forming a panel on 

the western wall of the mandapa directly opposite the shrine and 

depicting Siva as Gangadhara. The Siyamangalam . cave-temple is 

unique even atherwise, in having small sculpture panels on top of 

the facade pillars and pilasters in place of the lotus medallion The 

two panels on top of the two pilasters depict, respectively, a danc- 

ing form of Siva, or Tandavamurti—perhaps the earliest such 

representation in Pallava sculptures, and Siva and Uma standing 

with the bull behind them depicting the form called Vrishabhanti- 

kamurti. 



Mahendra’s son Nargsimhavarman Mamalla (630-68) and his 

lineal successors, Mahendravarman II (668-72), Paramesvara І. 

(672-700), and Rajasimha. (700-728). continued. the- tradition 

started by Mahendra I and excavated a number of cave-temples in 

the Mahendra style in the course of the century. They are the 

Orukal mandapam at Tirukkalukkunram, the Kotikal mandapam 

at Mahabalipuram, the Narasimha 'cave-temple at Singaperumal 

Kovil, the Ranganatha cave-temple at Singavaram, the Dharma- 

raja mandapam or Atyantakama Pallava's cave-temple at Maha- 

balipuram, and the Atiranachanda mandapam cave at Saluvankup- 

pam, near Mahabalipuram—all in the Chingleput district of Tamil 

Nadu, except Singavaram which is.in south Arcot. 



The Singavaram and Singaperumal Kovil cave-temples are dedi- ` 

cated to Vishnu, the Kotikal mandapam to Durga and tho rest to 

Siva. While none of the Siva cave-temples contain a rock-cut linga 

in the sanctum, the two Vishnu cave-temples have in the sanctum 

stucco figures of the deities now modernised. The Kotikal man- 

dapam of Durga has no sculpture of Durga inside the sanctum, 

though the dedication is indicated by the female dyarapalikas on 

either side of the shrine-entrance as also by the name Of the tem- 

ple. The Atiranachanda mandapam of Rajasimha, the Jast of the 

series, alone contains a bas-relief panel of. Siva as Somaskanda, 

with Uma and Skanda sitting beside him and Brahma and Vishnu 

standing on either side of the group behind. The carving of such a 





LATBR ROCK ARCHITECTURE ‘ 43 





bas-relief in place of the earlier traditional painting, or stucco- 

relief, or woodcarving of the principal god of the sanctum appears 

to have been started in the time of Paramesvaravarman I 

(672-700). Two more such Somaskanda reliefs are found carved 

on the hind wall of the mandapa on either side of the shrine- 

entrance. It would appear that while Mahendravarman I broke the 

tradition of the wooden and brick-and-mortar temples and exca- 

vated temples in stone, he could not go far enough to change the 

traditional material of which the principal deity in the. sanctum 

was made. ‘This had to wait for a few decades till Paramesvara- 

varman І, in the last quarter of the seventh century, introduced 

for the first time among other innovations the carving of the prin- 

cipal deity as a relief on the back wall of the shrine. In Raja- 

simha's cave-temple, the Atiranachanda mandapam, a black 

polished, fluted or sixteen-sided stone linga (dhara-linga) also came 

to be planted on the floor of the sanctum in front of the Somas- 

kanda relief on the hind wall. This indicated the commencement in 

the Pallava territory of the installation of the formless linga to 

represent Siva. 



In most respects this series of post-Mahendra cave-temples 

resembles those of Mahendra in plan and design and other general 

features. But one observes a tendency for the pillars and pilasters 



‘to become thinner and taller, sometimes flatter, with an oblong 

section. The space between them is equal but wider. The kapota 

over the facade -is still an undifferentiated, projecting rock-ledge 

over the beam. All the’ cave-temples of the series have single 

shrine-cells: cut into the rear walls, with the frontage projecting 

more into the mandapa. The only example with tripie shrine-cells 

is the Dharmaraja mandapam or Atyantakama Pallava's cave- 



' temple where the two lateral shrine-cells are simple excavations, 

which are perhaps later additions; without definite shrine-front, as 

is found in the case of the main central one. All these cave-temples 

have only two pillars and two pilasters on the mandapa facade, and 

a similar set behind inside the mandapa wherever there is such а 

demarcation of ardha- and mukha-mandapas, as in the Ranganatha 





44 - "TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





cave-temple, the Orukkal.mandapam, and the Dharmaraja manda- 

pam. The pillars have the top and. bottom: sadurams ~and inter- 

Vening kattu, while the pilasters are uniformly four-sided as in 

Mahendravarman's cave-temples except that in. the Singavaram 

Ranganatha cave-temple the pilasters like the pillars are demar-. 

cated and have lotus medallions on the saduram faces. This cave- 

temple is the only example in the series which has an outer pair of 

dvarapalas at either end of. the mandapa facade. The inner pair 

flanking the shrine entrance is in.common with the rest. 



"There are generally no other sculptures in the mandapa beside. 

the dvarapalas.In the Orukkal maridapam, however,,there are 

relief sculptures of standing Brahma and Vishnu on the rear wall, 

one on either side of the shrine-entrance and beyond the dyara-. 

palas. In addition there are twa fine, bold, life-size reliefs of dvara- 

pala-like sculptures, one on either. end wall of the mukha-mandapa. 

In the Singavaram. cave-temple; as at Siyamangalam, there are 

small panel reliefs of two female devotees on top of the pilasters 

of the inner row. j 

- The last series of Pallava temples dated after А.р. 730 are small 

and less interesting. They mark the decadent phase-of this type of 

rock architecture in Tondaimandalam. The Kilmavilangai 'cave- 

temple is the only example in the Pallava kingdom of Tondai- 

mandalam of a rock-cut cell without a rock-cut front mandapa; but 



“such cell-shrines are more common in the Pandya and Muttaraiyar 

and Kerala areas, most of them contemporary with the late, post- 

700 A.D. Pallava period. The cell contains on its hind wall a fat 

bas-relief of standing Visbnu. The two smaller cave-temples at 

. Vallam on the rock below Mahendra's Vasantesvaram cave-tem- 

ple, оле dedicated to Vishnu and the other to Siva, have very thin : 

pillars carrying bevelled corbels on the mandapa facade, the mandapa 

itself being narrow and the shrine-cell behind very, small. An ins- 

cription in script of the seventh century reading ‘Pa(1)lava-per- 

araisaru" meaning ‘Pallava emperor’ has since been found in the 

Vasantesvaram cave-temple in Vallam. This and the other almost 

similar excavation, both below the larger Mahendra- cave-temple,

are rather feeble attempts, considering the fact that they are rather 

crude, small in proportion and shallow in depth. 





THE PALLAVA: MAMALLA STYLE CAVE-TEMPLES 





Mahendra's great son and successor Narasimhavarman I 

Mamalla (630-668), in addition to excavating some Mahendra- 

style. cave-temples like the Orukkal mandapam and the Kotikal 

mandapam described earlier, initiated anew and more ornate 

series of cut-in cave-temples. This was in addition to his unique 

invention of totally cut-out monolithic temple-forms, /or vimanas, 

the so-called rathas, and some open air bas-relief compositions of 

considerable size and superb quality, all confined to the great 

Pallava port-city of Mamallapuram or Mahabalipuram. These 

ornate cave-temples that Mamalla initiated were mostly com- 

pleted in stages by his immediate successors for two Benerations, 

who also created a few monuments, in the same Style and at the 

same place. The outstanding development discernible in these is a 

fuller representation of their mandapa facades, their interior 

decoration and the replacement of the square massive pillars and 

pilasters by typical pillars with ornate' bases and full capitals 

and all the moulded members of the “order”, thus making the stone 

copies more true to their contemporary Structural originals in 

brick-and-timber. 



The adhishthana, or plinth, shows all the usual mouldings as 

could be seen in the finished examples. The mandapa facade bas а 

fully represented entablature, or prastara, which constitutes all the 

architectural parts coming over the beam and including it, as 

against what is seen in the Mahendra-style cave-temples. The pras- 

tara is fully finished with a flexed kapota, or ап eaves-like cornice 

projection, decorated by horse-shoe-shaped kudu arches, The 

prastara has also a string of miniature shrines above it, all of ob- 

long plan, often with a barrel-vaulted roof, the sala, while in the 

later examples, the sala string ends at either extremity in similar 



. miniature shrine models of square plan with a four-sided domical_ 





5 





46 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





roof, the kuta. The entire string constitutes what is called the .hara 

with inter-connecting lengths of cloister. The pillars generally con- 

form to the wooden prototypes, but are taller and slenderer and 

have their bases often shaped into squatting lions. The top of the 

shaft ‘has the variously moulded capital members such as the 

malasthana, the padmabandka, the kalasa, the tadi, the kumbha, the 

pali and the phalaka or abacus, the last-mentioned one omitted in 

some cases, and the topmost me ber carrying the corbel or potika, 





with curved profile and roll ornamentation, or faranga, with a 

median plain patta. rur 

Their mandapas are often demarcated into front and rear sections 

by an inner row of pillars. The shrine-fronts, ong, - three or five, 

are at the rear of the innet mandapa, project more into the man- 

dapa, and have all the angas of a vimana-front, namely, moulded 

adhishthana, pilasters, or kudya-stambhas, with capital components 

as detailed above and prastara, with well-formed kapota and kudu 

decorations. The further superstructure of the vimana is not shown, 

as in a depiction of the interior aspect of a mandapa with the 

sbrine-behind, the upper parts of the vimana would not be visible. 

The prastara of the shrine-front abuts on the mandapa ceiling. 

"There are eight such cave-temples in various stages of comple- 

tion: the Koneri mandapam, the Varaba mandapam, the Mahisha- 

mardini mandapam (locally called Yamapuri mandapam), an 

unfinished cave-temple next to the Koneri mandapam, the Pancha- 

Pandava mandapam, the Adivaraha cave-temple called Paramesvara 

Mahavaraha Vishnugriham in its inscriptions, and the Ramanuja 

mandapam. Of these the Varaha and Ramanuja mandapams have 

undivided mandapas, while the Koneri mandapam and the Adi- 

varaha cave-temple have their mandapas divided into ardha--and 

. mukha-mandapas by an inner line of pillars. The Mahishamardini 

mandapam is peculiar in that its principal central shrine is pre- 

ceded by a square and a pillared portico projected into the larger 

mandapa, as in the case of the Dalavanur cave-temple. The Pancha- 

Pandava mandapam records an attempt to cut a square central 

shrine with a surrounding cloister in the form of a mandapa having 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 47 





two rows of pillars running all round. The Varaha mandapam 

and the” Adivaraha cave-temples have each a single shrine-cell 

while the Mahishamardini and the Ramanuja mandapams have 

three shrine-cells in them; the Koneri mandapam has five in a row 

behind the mandapam. 



The Mamalla-style cave-temples show a marked advance over 

the Mahendra type in plastic decoration also, in having a wealth 

of large and fine sculptures in addition to the usual dyarapala 

sculptures. These are often synoptic, narrating important Puranic 

legends. The Varaha mandapam, which is the most complete cave- 

temple and has been preserved in all its parts, contains bas-relicf 

compositions of Bhu-varaha and Trivikrama inside large panels 

on the side walls of its mandapam. Its back wall has:two more—. 

one on either side of the projected shrine-entrance, carrying 

panels of Gajalakshmi and Durga. The front and side walls of the 

projected shrine-front have niches with dvardpala sculptures. The 

manner in which the boar-head of Bhu-varaha merges at the neck 

imperceptibly with the human body is a masterpiece of art not 

equalled by similar representations in the Gupta and other sculp- 

tures. The central shrine is now empty, but perhaps once contained 

painted or stucco representation of Narasimha. Almost identical, 

but more artistic and graceful delineations of Gajalakshmi and 

Durga are reproduced in almost the same positions on the rear 

wall panels on either side of the projected shrine-entrance in the 

Adivaraha cave-temple. In addition, the front wall of the projec- 

ted central shrine of the Adivaraha cave-temple has three niches 

each on either side of the entrance containing other sculptures. The 

niches flanking the entrance contain dvarapalas. The two central ' 

wider niches, one on each side have sculptures of standing Vishnu 

and Harihara, respectively. The extreme ones on the north апа. 

south show a Nagaraja or Adisesha in human form with a five- 

headed serpent-hood and a portrait sculpture in graceful tribhanga 

posture, The south and north walls of the mukha-mandapa contain 

large reliefs of standing Brahma, and Siva as Gangadhara. Similar 

panels on the south and north walls of the ardha-mandapa have 





48 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





almost life-size royal portrait groups of the Pallava Kings Simha- 

vishnu and Mahendra with their queens and consorts and with 

label inscriptions over them indicating their identity. The main 

sanctum contains a modern stucco form of Varahamurti. This 

temple is in use for worship, while others are not. The bas-relief 

sculptures of Durga on the south and Gajalakshmi (?) on the.north 

side walls of the Ramanuja mandapam have been totally chiselled 

off in later times by the Vaishnava occupants as also the three 

shrine-fronts and their dvarapalas of this original triple-celled Siva 

cave-temple. The back wall of the central shrine retains traces of a 

Somaskanda group. The Mahishamardini'cave-temple contains on 

the two side walls of its mandapa two of the most celebráted and 

famous Pallava sculptures, namely, Durga as Mahishasuramardini, 

mounted on a leaping lion and battling with Mahishasura and his. 

hordes on the north, and Vishnu as Anantasayin in yoga-nidra, or 

contemplative sleep, on a serpent-couch on the south. Besides the 

beauty, grace, vigour and agility depicted in Durga, the clever 

synthesis of the buffalo-head and human body of the demon 

Mahishasura would equal only that of the Varaha-form mentioned. 

above, not to speak of the defiance and haughtiness depicted by 

hisstance and demeanour even in the animal face. All these 

sculptures would thus constitute some of the earliest extant repre- 

sentations of the respective forms and as such afford valuable 

material for a study of the development of early iconography in 

“the south. 



Recent research (by Lockwood, Siromoney and Dayanandan— 

“Mahabalipuram Studies") has established that the dvarapalas 

of the Pallava cave-temples Saivaite and Vaishnavite, are really 

ayudapurushas, or defied personifications of the appropriate wea- 

pons of Siva (Sula and Parasu, i.e. trident and axe) or of Vishnu 

(Sanka and Chakra, ie. conch and discus), which are shown on 

the headgear of the concerned dvarapala. Also it has, been de- 

monstrated that the original dedication of the Mahishamardhini 

cave-temple was to Vishnu, subsequently made Saivaite in the same 

century by the introduction of the large Somaskanda panel, on the - 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 49 





lined wali of the shrine, in place of the original Vishnu 'that was 

perhaps a painted stucco. Appropriately enough the two dyara- 

Palas wedged in a curious паппег into the narrow spaces on either 

. Side of the shrine's door-jamb, were afterthoughts likewise, modi- 

fied for the Saivite re-dedication as also the two flanking shrine- 

cells on either side in the Trimurti pattern, Vishnu occupying the 

place of precedence in the central cella in the original scheme. 

Though not strictly cave-temples like his Atiranachanda man- 

dapam, other creations of Rajasimha Pallava (700-728) in the series 

of rock-carvings found in Mahabalipuram and neighbourhood are 

the Yalimandapam at Saluvankuppam, a hamlet to the north of 

Mahabalipuram, familiarly called *tiger cave', and similar orna- 

mental pavilions. These would stand apart from either group of 

cave-temples described above. The Yalimandapam is a small, 

oblong, shallow pavilion, or mandapa, excavated on the eastern 

face of a boulder facing the sea with its moulded adhishthana and 

a facade of flanking pillars which are adorned at their bases by 

rearing or rampant lions or vyalas, cut over a lower platform re- 

ached by a flight of steps. The whole structure is surrounded by an 

arched frieze of eleven large vyala heads, mistakenly called “tiger 

heads’. To the south of the pavilion, and carved on the rock face, 

are reliefs of two elephant fronts with howdahs over their necks, a 

dvajastambha in between, and a horse at the south extreme. The 

northern face of the rock is roughly carved out into a large squat- 

ting lion front with a small square niche cut into in its bosom 

enshrining a relief panel of Mahishamardini. The Yalimandapam 

obviously served as a resting-place of the processional idols or the 

royalty during festivals.. This, even the name of the place—Tiru- 

veluchchiyur —found in the inscriptions, would suggest. A smaller 

replica of the Yalimandapam is found on the surf-beaten boulder 

to the south of the Shore temple.in Mahabalipuram. To the north. 

of the temple is another larger rock called the Mahishamardini 

rock with a large lion face and Durga niche in its bosom. 

In passing, mention may be made of the two celebrated open- 

air bas-relief compositions of large group sculptures on the face 





SIT TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





of the massive rocks in Mahabalipuram. They are Arjuna's Pen- 

ance and the Govardhana-Krishna scenes. The compositions are 

both synoptic and narrative of the respective themes. Arjuna's 

Penance depicts the scene of Siva granting to Arjuna as a boon 

the desired weapon—Pasupata— sought by the latter through 

the performance of a severe penance. The depiction is. after the 

description of the scene in Bharavi's Kiratarjuniya. The Govar- 

dhana-Krishna scene depicts Krishna as holding up the hill to 

afford shelter to the displaced gopas and gopis with their/child- 

ren, cattle and other belongings, when they had to flee their homes 

as a result of a great deluge of rain and stone brought down by 

the irate Indra. The depiction is quite powerful and realistic. А 

unique south Indian note is struck by the introduction of Krishna's 

`. favourite gopi, Nappinnai, huddling near him in the group and 

distinguished from the rest of the women in the scene by her 

dress, stance and attendant lady. The Krishna-Nappinnai theme 

“is special to the earlier and contemporary Tamil literature and 

tradition. 





PANDYA AND OTHER NON-PALLAVA 

CAVE-TEMPLES OF THE SOUTH 





In Pandimandalam farther south, comprising mainly the modern 

districts of Madurai, Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari, 

Trivandrum and Quilon, and the southern parts of the Puduk- 

kottai area now forming a district, the Pandya contemporaries 

of the Pallavas started rock architecture soon after the pioneers, 

that is to say from after the middle of the seventh century. They 

continued the activity for over three centuries till they, like the 

Pallavas, were. overthrown by the rising Cholas of Thanjavur. 

Their cave-temples in the southern half of Tamil Nadu and the 

adjoining Kerala area: are far more numerous than those of-the 

Pallavas. ` 

, The Muttaraiyar chieftains, who had their kingdom astride the 



Kaveri in the traditional Cholamandalam, viz. Tiruchirapalli, 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 51 





Thanjavur and the southern half of the south Arcot districts, and 

who owned allegiance alternately to the Pallavas and Pandyas, 

left in the latter part of the period quite a few cave-temples in 

their area. These are found at Tiruvellarai, Narttamalai, Kun- 

nandarkovil, Puvalaikkudi and other places, all in the Puduk- 

kottai and Tiruchirapalli districts. Their cave-temples too are 

the type of mandapas with simple shrine-cells and are much akin : 

to the Pandya cave-temples in the same area, The Atiyaman, or 

Adigaiman chiefs, ruling in the Kongu area of Salem and Coim- 

batore districts, bordering on the Tiruchirapalli district, have 

excavated two fine cave-temples in Namakkal. They are dedicated 

to Vishnu and are noted for their fine sculptured panels. 



These cave-temples, numbering about sixty in all, are, like the 

Pallava examples, excavated into the hard, local rocks and are 

essentially similar to the Mahendra-style excavations in plan and 

design. But they also show certain characteristic features of their 

own, incorporating in the process a few features peculiar to the 



. Chalukyan examples, particularly in respect of their sculptural 

make-up and iconography. 



They, like the Mahendra-style cave-temples, consist of a man- 

dapa with one or more: shrine-cells cut often at the rear, but in 

some cases excavated into the side walls of the mandapa, as in the 

lower rock-cut Pandya cave at Tiruchirapalli and the cave-temple 

at Tirupparankunram, near Madurai, among others. They have 

massive pillars on the facades, essentially square in section at the 

base and top, with an octagonal middle section, carrying heavy 

potikas or corbels, usually with а straight bevel, resulting in an 

angular profile. There are, however, some examples with pillars 

of other types and corbels with a curved profile and taranga 

moulding. The cave-temples, all, lack a well-defined kapota in 

the architrave over their mandapa facades, as is also the case in 

the Mahendra-style cave-temples. 



Some of the excavations are merely shrine-cells Scooped 

directly 'into the rock face, without a rock-cut mandapa in 

front. Such cave-temples are numerous inthis region and very 





52 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





rare in Tondaimandalam. . í ye 



The cave-temple at Malaiyadi-k-kurichi (Tirunelveli district) 

would appear to be the earliest known Pandya cave-temple of 

the mandapa-type with a single shrine-cell on the rear and con- 

taining a foundation inscription of the seventeenth year of Pandya 

Maran Sadaiyan in the second half of the seventh century. The 

inscription mentions the cave-temple significantly as kal-tiru-k- 

koyil or the sacred stone temple’, echoing the pioneering idea 

for this region as found in Pallava Mahendravarman's inscription 

at Mandagapattu in Tondaimandalam. The rock-cut cave-temple 

at Pillaiyarpatti; (Ramanathapuram distríct) with an inscription 

in an archaic script would also be one of the early Pandya cave- 

temples, as also Siva Cave-temple III at Kunnakkudi in the same 

district which has another short inscription in the same script 

calling it Masilisvaram. The Vishnu (Narasimha) cave-temple at 

Anaimalai (Madurai district) has а foundation, inscription giving 

the Kali year 3871 (А.р. 770) and referring to its excavation bya 

minister of Pandya Maran Sadaiyan, alias Parantaka. The large 

cave-temple at present famous as the Subrahmanya temple at 

Tirupparankunram near Madurai was excavated earlier and later 

re-modelled by. another Pandya minister and his wife in the Kali 

year 3874 (A.D. 773), according to their foundation inscriptions 

there. There is a complex of four cave-temples on this northern 

face of the Tirupparankunram rock and one of the above inscrip- 

tions mentions the excavation of a separate Jyeshtha cave-temple 

also, which is of the cave-cell type, without mandapa in front. 

The other two excavations: on either side of the larger mandapa- 

type cave-temple and above the level,of. the Jyeshtha cave-shrine 

should be of a somewhat later date. One of these containsa base 

relief of Gajalakshmi, and the other, a group comprising Devi as 

Bhuvanesvari and her attendants. 



The well-known rock-cut cave-temple at Sittannavasal in the 

Pudukkottai area (Tiruchirapalli district), containing the celebra- 

ted early mural paintings in fresco, is an example of a Jain cave- 

temple of the eighth-ninth centuries. This, according to a long 





[WA 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 53 





Verse inscription associated with it, was re-embellished by a cer- 

tain Ilan-Gautaman alias Madurai Asiriyan and a structural 

mukha-mandapa added in front, all in the reign of Avanipa- 

sekhara Sri Vallabha Pandya (c. 815-862). This contains 'bas-relief 

Jain Tirthankara sculptures on the hind wall of the shrine and in 

the niches on the lateral walls of the mandapa in front. This 

cave-temple is a typical Pandya version of а Mahendra-style cave- 

temple, with the facade pillars carrying taranga corbels. 



The eastern cave-temple at Malaiyakkovil, the upper Siva cave- 

temple at Tirumayam, the cave-temple at Mangadu, the Malaik- 

kolundisavaran near Rayavaram, the Jyeshtha, the Gajalakshmi 

' and the Bhuvanesvari cave-temples in Tirupparankunram, and the 



cave-temple at Vizinam (Vizhingam), among others, are examples 

of simple cave-shrines of the Pandya-Muttaraiyar-Ayvel vintage of 

the non-Pallava series. 



Among the cave-temples that have the shrine-cell on one of the 

lateral walls of the mandapa may be mentioned the Satyagirisvara 

orSiva cave-temple at Tirumayam, the southern caye-temple at 

Malaiyakkovil, the Siva cave-temple at Tirumalapuram (Tirunelveli 

district), and the Umaiyandar cave-temple on the southern face of 

the rock at Tirupparankunram. In the case of some cave-temples, 

like the Siva cave-temple at Malaiyadippatti, the cave-temple at 

Pillaiyarpatti, and the cave-temple in Muvaraivenran (Ramanatha- 

puram district) the shrine part occupies, as it were, a corner of the 

oblong mandapam, which thus encloses it on two sides—in front 

and on one of the flanks, suggesting a partial copy of a model with 

а central shrine and a surrounding mandapam with а greater part 



'ofitin front. Such a plan is not to be found conimonly in the 

Pallava examples except in the case ofthe Pancha-Pandava manda- 

pam of Mahabalipuram ind the unfinished Cave-temple IV at 

Mamandur. The cave-temple at Trikur, near Trichur in Kerala, is 



L large excavation of a square chamber with a Zinga at the centre. 

Cave-temples with shrine-cells cut into both the lateral walls of 

the mandapa are exemplified by the lower rock-cut cave-temple 

at Tiruchirapalli and also the larger cave-temple, called the 





| 54 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Subrahmanya temple, on the north face of the hill at Tirupparan- 

kunram. This has also a third shrine cut into the rear wall of the 

mandapa, in addition to the two thus excavated into either end 

wall of the mandapam. 

While the mandapa-type facade pillar with a cubical base and 

top and an octagonal belt in between is the general rule, as in the 

Mahendra-style cave-temples, there are often variations. For ex- 

ample, in the Melaikkovil at Kudumiyamalai capital components 

like the kalasa, kumbha, etc. are cut on tops of the facade 

. columns. In the Vishnu cave-temple at Malaiyadippatti the pillar 

bases are shaped into squatting lions. The corbels of the Malai- 

yadikkurichi cave-temple are peculiar in that the ‘arqnga rolls are 

cut as incurved curls, a feature indicating Chalukyan inspiration. 

What is more interesting in these cave-temples is their varied 

sculptural content and iconographic forms, some of which are the 

first to appear in the southern cave-temples of Tamil Nadu and 

Kerala. They are Ganesa, the Saptamatrika and Jyeshtha. The 

Ganesa and the Saptamatrika cults would thus appear to have 

come into the far south from the Chalukyan area through the 

Ganga region, before they penetrated the Tondaimandalam of the 

Pallavas. These two are not to be seen in any of the Pallava cave- 

temples, till they make their first appearance in the structural 

temples of Rajasimha Pallava (700-725) as, for example, in the 

Kailasanatha at Kanchi. In the far south, Ganesa is to be found 

inthe cave-temples at Pillaiyarpatti, Kudumiyamalai, Malaiyak- 

kovil (southern cave-temple), Tirugokarnam, Kunnandarkovil, 

Tiruvellarai (Siva cave-temple), Devarmalai, Tirukkalakkudi, 

Tiruchirapalli (lower cave-temple), Tirumalapuram, Kunnakkudi, 

Muvaraivenran, Tirupparankunram (larger cave-temple), Sevilip- 

patti, Kunnattur (Nilakanthesvara), Virasikhamani and Aritta- 

patti. The Saptamatrika group is met with in the cave-temples at 

Tirugokarnam, Malaiyadippatti, Tirukkalakkudi and Kunnattur. 

While many of the cave-temples dedicated to Siva have a rock-cut 

linga with a pitha in the shrine, there are others where the iconic 

forms of Siva are represented as bas-reliefs on the rear wall of

the sanctum, There is often a small cistern or pit cut into the floor 

of the sanctum below the projected channel-spout of the top of 

the linga-pitha or image pedestal to receive and collect the abhi- 

Sheka water. This feature is unknown in the Pallava temples, 

whether cave, monolithic or structural, but is found in the 

Chalukyan area and in the far-off temples of the Dieng Valley in 

Java (Indonesia). The linga-pitha is generally square, but octagonal 

in the eastern cave-temple at Malaiyakkovil. In the Siva shrine of 

the Tirupparankunram cave-temple, there is a Somaskanda panel 

on the rear wall, as in the Pallava cave-temples of the close of the 

seventh century and subsequent structural temples. In the cave- 

temples at Piranmalai and Tirumalai (Ramanathapuram district) 

.it is only Siva and Parvati (Umasahitamurti) seated, without 

Skanda. The rear wall of the shrine of the Umaiyandar cave- 

temple at Tirupparankunram contains a relief of Ardhanari-Siva 

while in the case of Ladan Kovil cave-temples at Anaimalai, 

dedicated to Subrahmanya, he is shown with his consort in the 

central shrine.

relief of Somaskanda on its rear wall after the familiar Pallava 

pattern, the reliefs of Umasahitamurti (Siva), without Skanda, in 

the Pandyan cave-temples is significant. Such icons found for 

example on the rear wall of the shrine in the cave-temples of 

Piranmalai and Tirumalai (Ramanathapuram district), and on 

the north wall of the rock-cut front mandapa of the Kunnandarkoil 

(Pudukkottai district) cave-temple are reminiscent of the Siva- 

Parvati wedlock, or vaivahika form of Minakshi-Sundaresvara, 

prevalent in that region. 



In the lower rock-cut cave-temple at Tiruchirapalli (Pandya), 

while the two lateral shrine-cells are dedicated to Siva and Vishnu, 

the rear wall of the mandapa has five niches enclosed by pilasters, 

the central one with Brahma and tbe others with Ganesa, Subrah- 

manya, Surya and Durga. With Siva and Vishnu, these would 

form the gods of the Shanmata grouping which Sankaracharya is

stated to have re-established after reformation of the extant ritual 

practices. Sankara is reputed to be the Shanmata sthapanacharya, 

the Shanmatas being Saiva, Vaishnava, Sakta, Kaumara, Saura and 

Ganapatya. The grouping in this cave-temple would indicate also 

а super-imposition of the Shanmata deities on the pre-existing 

Trimurti concept of Siva, Vishnu and Brahma, inaugurated by 

Mahendra Pallava in his first Mandagaputtu cave-temple. The 

larger cave-temple at Tirupparankunram takes in five-out of the 

six deities, excluding Surya, for the two principal lateral shrines 

are dedicated to Siva and Vishnu, while a third, for Durga, has 

been cut out of the rear wall at its centre with the two recesses 

on either side having sculptures of Ganesa and Subrahmanya. In 

the comparatively fewer Vishnu cave-temples dedicated solely as 

such and in the Vishnu shrines of other cave-temples, the stand- 

ing, seated and, more often, reclining forms are met with as the 

main sculptures. The standing form occurs in the Vishnu shrine 

of the Tiruchirapalli lower cave-temple, the sitting form in the 

Vishnu shrine of the larger Tirupparankunram cave-temple, and 

reclining form in the Vishnu cave-temples at Tirumayam, Malai- 

yadippatti and Tiruttangal (Ramanathapuram district), and in the 

eastern or Ranganatha cave-temple at Namakkal (Salem district). 

The other cave-temple at Namakkal has Narasimha in the 

sanctum. 



The MelaikKovil Siva temple at Kudumiyamalai, the Satyagiri- 

svara or Siva cave-temple at Tirumayam, the upper Siva cave- 

shrine in the same place, the Gokarnesvara.cave-temple at 

Tirugokarnam and the eastern cave-shrine at Malaiyakkovil are 

associated with inscriptions on musical notations in what is called 

the Pallava-grantha script as also colophons in the old Tamil 

script, as indicated by the label Parivadini-e inscribed on them. 

While the actual notations, or remnants of them, are to be seen in 

the first two cases, they have disappeared in the rest. The extant 

colophons indicate that the art of the Parivadini (a stringed lute) 

called Vidya-parivadini was enunciated by a Gunasena, and the 



notations were got inscribed for the benefit of the votaries by a 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 57 





king who was a great Saiva or Paramamahesvara, and a disciple 

of Rudracharya. While the Satyagirisvara cave-temple at Tiruma- 

yam is thus connected by the presence-of the musical inscription 

with the others above, it has besides, as one of its dvarapalas 

flanking the shrine-entrance, a portrait sculpture of a king or chief- 

tain which is found also in the cave-temples at Kunnandarkovil 

and Devarmalai within 48 km from it in the same district 

(Pudukkottai). What is more, itis also found in the Siva cave- 

temple at Virasikhamani in the far-southern Tirunelveli district 

and in the cave-temple at Kaviyur, near Quilon in Kerala. These 

would indicate a similarity of origin, namely, Pandya, and a proxi- 

mity of date. The cave-temple at Tirunandikkara with a south- 

facing mandapa facade and an east-facing shrine inside on the 

western wall of the mandapa is celebrated for the remains of ancient 

fresco paintings of the same period as Sittannavasal and Tirumala- 

puram of Pandya vintage. 



The Siva cave-temple called Vagisvaram at Malaiyadippatti was 

excavated by Videl Vidugu Muttaraiyar in the 16th year of Pallava 

Dantivarman. The adjoining Vishnu cave-temple of a later date 

was also perhaps a Muttaraiyar excavation. The cave-shrine called 

Paliyilisvaram at Narttamalai, another Muttaraiyar excavation, 

dates a few years before the seventh year of Pallava Nripatunga in 

the late ninth century. The same may be said of the Puvalaikkudi 

cave-shrine, which was excavated by a certain Amarunri Mutta- 

raiyar- The Vishnu cave-temple at Tirumayam, containing the 

reclining - Vishnu group, is a natural cavern converted into a cave- 

temple with the addition of the facade pillars and other features by 

а queen.of Perumbidugu Muttaraiyar and would date some time 

later than the Siva cave-temple of Satyagirisvara adjoining it. A 

few others like the Mangadu cave-shrine and Malaikkolundisvaram 

cave-shrine in the same area, as also the cave-temples at Tiruvel- 

larai,-can be attributed to the Muttaraiyars. 



The cave-temples at Trikur, Irunilamkodu, Kottukkal and other 

places in the northern Kerala region are of the times of the. rulers 

-of the Chera country, while those in the southern parts, in the 





53 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Quilon and Trivandrum districts of Kerala, and the Kanyakumari 

district of Tamil Nadu, or Venadu and Nanjilnadu as they are 

called, are perhaps mostly of the Pandya affiliation. Because of 

lack of specific authentication and of the fact that Kerala was 

under more than one dynasty during the period from the middle 

of the seventh to the middle of the ninth centuries to which these 

cave-temples belong, it would be more correct to give them the 

regional nomenclature of Kerala than to call these all ‘Chera’. 

The connected political history of the Cheras of the second period 

after the earlier Sangam epoch starts from the middle of the ninth 

century. 



The two Vishnu cave-temples at Namakkal, one dedicated to 

Ranganatha or Anantasayin, and the other to Narasimha, are, 

according to their inscriptions, excavations by the Atiya king, 

Gunasila of the line of the Adigaimans known earlier from Tamil 

literature. They belong to the first half of the eighth century and 

contain some fine sculptures. The inscription in the Ranganatha 

cave calls it Atiyendra-Vishnu-griha and is unique in that it gives 

an apt description of the various figures in the iconographic group- 

ing round Anantasayin. The sculptures are noted for their .sharp 

delineation and vigorous poses and flexions that are quite distinct 

from their Pallava compeers. 



The Western Gangas of Talkad in south Mysore, following the 

Chalukya-Kashtrakuta idiom, have left two unfinished cave-temples. 

in the hard rock at Melkote near Mysore. 



In addition to the incorporation of the Chalukyan traits noted 

above, these southern cave-temples, essentially following the 

Pallava Mahendra-style and hard rock tradition, also reproduce 

many iconicforms that are fóund in the Pallava rock-cut and 

structural examples. The more-important ones are the reproduction 

. of Durga with a devotee cutting off his own head in sacrifice, a 

common Pallava form, reproduced near the Vishnu cave-temple 

at Tiruttangal, and the Mahishasuramardini group, as at Maha- 

balipuram and Saluvankuppam, reproduced with variations in the 

Vagisvaram cave-temple at Malaiyadippatti. The Bhu-varaha and 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 59 





“ 





Gajalakshmi forms are found in the cave-temples at Tirupparan- 

kunram and the Trivikrama form along with Bhu-varaha in the 

cave-temple at Namakkal, The other iconographic forms so repro- 

duced are Lingodbhava, Harihara, Subrahmanya, Vishnu with 

Garuda in human form, Narasimha, and the tandava forms of 

Siva. 



The Kerala cave-temples of a rather indeterminate authorship, 

however, form an important landmark in southern cave architec- 

ture combining as they do the features of the Pandya and the 

Adigaiman cave-temples of the adjoining territory and like them 

are essentially of the Pallava Mahendra-style model both in their 

granite rock material and the plan and technique of excavation, 

though with an import often of some Chalukyan motifs. The 

incomplete Branthanpara excavation demonstrates the familiar 

Pallava technique of rock excavation as at Mahabalipuram, follow- 

ed in the Pandya-Muttaraiyar-Adigaiman areas, as at Narttamalai, 

Mangadu and other places. The cave at Vizhinam, of the rock-cell 

type without the front mandapa and characteristic of the Pandya- 

Muttaraiyar region, is unique in having on either rock flank of its 

door-opening, reliefs of Siva in chatura tandava with Parvati in 

attendance on one side, and Siva with bow as Kirata, followed by 

a dwarf gana on the other. These bas-relief sculptures are more 

akin to the Pallava than to the neighbouring Pandya forms. At 

Irunilamkodu, another simple diminutive single-cell excavation 

without any facade or front porch, is a fine sculpture of Yoga 

Dakshinamurti in a majestic pose on the south wall, with an atten- 

dant rishi and disciples below, while the Zinga proper is placed in 

a small niche cut into the western wall over a platform. The other 

cave-temples are those at Tirunandikkara and Kaviyur. These are 

examples of typical cave-temple pattern with cell and front 

mandapa. Likewise there are those at Kallil, Trikkur, Kottukkal, 

Ailurpara, Tuvarangadu and Bhutapandi, the last two to the south 

of Vizhinam, near Kanyakumari. Some of these cave-temples are 

unconventional in so far as the relationship between the orient- 

ation of the temple and the placement of the dyarapalas and other 





60 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





attendant niche-deities are concerned. The Trikkur cave-temple, for 

example, has a north facing facade with the only opening on that 

side; the corbels are of the double-volute type as in the Chalukyan 

style and the deity inside the shrine faces east as indicated by the 

water-spout of the linga-pitha projected on the north. The dvara- 

palas are cut almost in the round out of the side walls.on the 

eastern and western sides, a little behind the median east-west axial 

line. The linga-pitha is often'a structural addition, though mono- 

lithic examples cut out of the same rock as the cave itself are 

known. At Kaviyur and Tirunandikkara the style is, as in early 

Pallava cave-temples, without the original rock-cut linga but with 

lingas planted into sockets of the” shrine-cell. We have square 

sockets on the floor into which the square-sectioned lower part, or 

brahmabhaga, of the linga is inserted, and the pitha assembled 

round its exposed base, as is found to bethe case in the Pallava 

cave-temples, a feature starting from about A.D. 700. In Ailurpara 

and Bhutapandi, the Zinga is an integral part of the cave and is 

rock-cut as in the Pandya-Muttaraiyar examples. The placement of 

Hanuman as one of the two dvarapalas in the cave-temple at 

Kottukkal recalls the similar feature found in the Pandya cave- 

temple at Kunnattur, near Madurai. ES

The: Chalukyas of Badami from the middle of the sixth century 

A.D. and the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta who supplanted them 

effectively in the middle. of the eighth century, together with the 

Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi have left a number of cave-temples in 

the region between the Tapti and the north Pennar rivers, extend- 

ing from coast to coast. The Chalukyas of Vengi were a collateral 

line that had independently started ruling the Andhra coast from 

the commencement of the seventh century under Kubja Vishnu- 

vardhana,.the intrepid brother of Pulakesin IL, and continued 





:throughoutthe period. The cave-temples are to be found at

LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 61 





Badami, Aihole, Ellora, Bhokardan, Elephanta, Jogeshvari, Poona, 

Arvalem (Goa), Mahur, Advisomanpalli, Vijayawada, Mogulraja- 

puram, Undavalli, Sitaramapuram, Penamaga and Bhairavakonda. 

While the Chalukyas were mostly of Hindu persuasion, though 

they encouraged the Jain creed, the Rashtrakutas and many of the. 

Western Gangas were votaries of Jainism. As such one could 

perceive a congruity of purpose, technique and the raw material 

chosen to stabilise Hinduism and foster Jainism and perpetuate 

their traditions at the cost of Buddhism which was having till then 

a greater hold on the rich, lay, agricultural and mercantile sections 

of the people. 



The choice of all these dynasties was the local soft stone forma- 

tions, viz. sandstone, as in Badami and Aihole and in most other 

places, laterite, as at Arvalem on the extreme west coast, schist as 

at Bhairavakonda, and trap on the north-west Deccan and western 

India around Aurangabad, Poona and Bombay. The Western 

Gangas alone despite their Chalukyan affinities as stated before 

made a deviation in that they excavated into the hard local granite. 

as at Melkote (Mysore). 



The eastern branch of the Chalukyas, ruling from Vengi, though 

excavating into soft rocks, followed a different mode and design 

in their cave-temples which took in what was prevalent in eastern 



- Andhra and northern Tamil Nadu, or Tondaimandalam, with 

Pallava affinities, thus inaugurating what was jo be a distinct 

Andhra tradition, as opposed to what the Badami Chalukyas did 

for Kannada tradition and culture. 



The. Chalukya-Rashtrakuta domination of the areas to the west 

resulted in the upper Deccan affiliations becoming quite distinct 

from what obtained in the lower Deccan, thus exhibiting two 

regional idioms. This was because the -northern zone lay nearer 

the sites of the earlier Buddhist cave art and rock architecture. The 

skills and traditions that had prevailed for more than eight 

centuries among the local guilds of craftsmen thus continued in the 

generations that took up Hindu and Jain rock architecture and 

cave art. Rock architecture was also sustained longer as a mode in 





62 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





the northern zone. It developed more vigorously particularly under 

the Rashtrakutas as could be seen from their enormous output 

and such large-scale compositions as the caves at Elephanta, 

Dhumarlena and Jogeshvari, not to speak of the monolithic 

carvings of the Kailasa temple, and the Jain Chota Kailasa and 

the Jain Chaumukh in tbe Indra Sabha complex. But rock architec- 

ture soon became a mere second to structural stone constructions 

in the southern zone of the Chalukyas as would be seen in the 

sequel. This was due to the fact that with the facility of quarrying 

the soft sandstone blocks, dressing and catving them more easily 

with the help of the skills acquired, coupled with the urge to con- 

struct stone temples on the models of brick-and-wood originals, 

the stone workers of the Badami-Aihole-Pattadkal area soon 

trained themselves into guilds of stapatis that could build temples 

better instead of carving them out of rocks. The structural crea- 

tions of the Rashtrakuta period are, however, less pretentious, of 

medium or small dimensions, and less well-finished as comparéd 

with their rock-cut monuments. 



The lay-out plan of the cave-temples varied from the structural 

temples in the successive rise in floor levels of the axial mandapas 

and shrine, in the much raised level of the sanctum floor, though 

the ceiling level throughout remained thc same, The development 

of these non-Buddhist cave-temples can be divided into five or six 

stages or patterns. In the first group would be those that follow 

the scheme generalised by thelater Buddhists in that area, namely, 

the vihara-chaitya type, with a cella and a frontal pillared hall. The 

second would be those with a triple cella at the rear and lateral 

dispositions, each with a pillared facade. in the form of an ardha- 

mandapa, the whole fronted by a common larger hall, or maha- 

mandapa, and a narrower agra- or mukha-mandapa, again with a 

pillared facade. Thirdly, there would be those which show or tend 

to show the side shrines in the form of chambers containing panel 

sculptures and Saptamatrika shrines with a regular or principal 

sanctum at the rear, which is sandhara or one provided with a 

circumambulatory passage round it, with ardha-and maha-niandapas 





< 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 63 





often having vedi parapets. A Nandi-mandapa is also to be seen in 

front in some cases as-in-the Lankesvara cave at Ellora (Kailasa 

complex). The fourth type is exemplified by the structures where: 

the principal shrine has no cirumambulatory passage, that is, 

nirandhara; the ardha-mandapa has sculpture panels on its side 

walls, and the large maha-mandapa is pillared and with or without 

side shrines. Often there is an additional mykha-mandapa. The 

Saptaniatrika shrine, or niche, is cut independently outside the 

main cave-temple, usually on its left flank, while there is a Nandi- 

mandapa in front, as in Ellora Cave 22. The fifth group would be 

that where the sandhara pattern with circumambulation develops a 

sarvatobhadra sanctum cell, with door-openings on all the four 

sides, fronted by a series of two or three mandapas, and, in the 

most advanced type, having an additional agra-mandapa that con- 

tains sculpture panels of Ganesa, Durga and other forms on ane 

side and the Saptamatrikas on the other side of the agra-mandapa. 

Lastly, there are the examples which, like the more southern forms, 

have in front the transversely oblong halls—the ardha- and mukha- 

mandapas, without any vedi parapet for the latter, and where the 

pillars carry the sculptures on their shaft portions instead of on the 

bracket region as female figures that are usual in other cases. - 



Thus the main varieties observed in the Chalukyan cave-temples 

are with individual variations: the nirandhara type where the 

shrinc-cells are devoid of a circumambulatory passage as at 

Badami, the sandhara type, with shrine-cells having a circumambu- 

latory passage zi a iiio.a, Ramesvara, etc., the frikuta type with 

triple shrine-cells as at Aihole and Ellora, and the sarvatobhadra 

type with shrine-cells having door-openings on all the four sides as 

at Elephanta, Ellora and Jogeshvari. The sandhara and saryato- 

bhadra forms are the most outstanding. In the sarvatobhadra types, 

as seen in the Dhumarlena at Ellora, the principal cave at Eleph- 

an fa, and in the cave at Jogeshvari, the outer mandapa cut out of 

the rock tends to have at least three open passages on the three 

sides, while the fourth at tbe rear forms the one ending in tbe 

parent rock, 





66 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





cave, mandapa-type also finds its structural analogues particularly 

in temples of the south-west Deccan, west Mysore and the Konkan 

and Malabar coasts down to the times of the Ikkeri Nayaks of 

the seventeenth century. The provision of more aisles or bays 

parallel to the central nave with only one extreme bay at either 

end of the longitudinal axis finds its application in structural 

temples where the lateral bays, with pillars or walls of diminishing 

height from the centre, carry successively stepped down, slopy- or 

-flat roofs. Such early structural temples are the Ladkhan in Aihole 

and the Kallamatha in Badami. It would be evident that this 

feature in rock architecture is after the contemporary and earlier 

brick-and-timber structural models. The Ramesvara facade at 

Ellora would also indicate the prototype or archetype of mandapa 

of mediaeval structural temples. The projected porches have 

bench-like platforms with seats and lean-backs between the pillars, 

the kakshasanas, their exterior view being parapet-like with a vedi 

form and dwarf pillars and other decorations and sculptures. As a 

result the intercolumniation of the facade is not generally equal, 

the central pillars having a wider interspace than the lateral ones. 

In Badami there are four 'cave-temples excavated at various 

-heights on the vertical scarp of the sandstone rock. These are 

reached by a natural incline in front with steps. The earliest and 

largest one is Cave III excavated by Mangalesa in. A.D. .578 and 

dedicated to Vishnu. It is cut at the most commanding height 

visible from the valley in front. Cave-temple I, which is of medium 

size and is Saiva, and tbe smallest Cave-temple II, which is Vaish- 

naya, are cut at lower levels, the former being almost near ground 

level. Cave-temple IV, also small but Jain, cut near the top of the 

` rock, came much later than the other three which belong to the 

last quarter of the sixth century. These cave-temples consist of a 

rectangular pillared mukha-mandapa preceding a. more or less 

square pillared maha-mandapa with a shrine-cell at the rear end. 

The ardha-mandapa that should intervene between the shrine and 

` the maha-mandapa is not distinct, and is taken up by the rear bays 

of the maha-mandapa. The facade opening is wide and sufficiently 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 67 





high. The facade pillars are tall and massive, often of a square 

section, carrying corbels, or potika, supporting the beam. The 

massive overhanging ledge over the beam forms eaves or cornice, 

the kapota, with ribbing and cross-pieces imitating a frame-work 

carved on its curved underside. The beams over the potika, as also 

the underframe of the kapota, are often strutted, as it were, by 

bold. caryatid-like supports of human, celestial or animal figures 

sculptured almost in the round. The inter-columniation between 

the two central pillars is wider than that between the others. The 

ceilings of the mukha-mandapa or agra-mandapa are sunk into 

regular four-sided coffers by thick cross-beams that are filled with 

carved medallions in relief. The inner pillars, especially of the inner 

row of the mukha-mandapa, though square at the base, are of a 

circular ‘section above, complete with the moulded capital com- 

ponents, viz. the vase-shaped kalasa and the cushion-shaped 

bulbous kumbha, to mention only the most prominent ones. The 

pillared maha-mandapa, as already stated, has a wider nave at the 

centre than the lateral aisles, and the inner pillars are polygonal in 

section. A functional division of the mukha-mandapa from the 

central hall is shown by the introduction of a screen wall stretch- 

ing to about a fourth of the width from either end between the two 

mandapas with the front pillars and pilasters of the maha-mandapa 

fitted in the central gap. The higher floor-level of the central nave 

would suggest a central clerestory roof, rising above the roofs of 

the side aisles as could be seen in the structural examples referred 

to before, though in this rock-cut model the ceiling is of even 

height right through. Cave I has a monolithic linga-pitha and is 

slightly later in póint of time. Cave II would be slightly later than 

Cave III which has only a monolithic pitha for the original Vishnu 

image. The recessed kantha ofthe plinth of the mukha-mandapa 

facade in Cave III shows paired pilasters;interposed between the 

gana groups while in Caves Land II the gana friezes are continu- 

ous, There are no Vaishnava friezes on the ceiling in the front 

mandapa of Siva Cave I while they are present in the earlier Caves 

JI and III, which are Vaishnava. The Jain cave-temple of a still 





68 TEMPLES- OF SOUTH INDIA 





later date is replete with Jain sculptures and cameos, while the 

other three are noted for some of their bold wall sculptures, mostly 

subsequent additions. 



In respect of the-sculpture panels, even in Cave III of Badami, 

‘the earliest of the series, it has been demonstrated (by A. Lippe) 

on the basis of technical and stylistic evidence that, they, barring 

the Vaikunthanatha (seated Vishnu) and Varahamurti, are not 

coeval with the cave excavation, but additions, made at a slightly 

Játer time, about the middle of the seventh century, possibly after 

the period.of Pallava occupation of Badami by Mamalla. 



Of the two .rock-cut cave-temples at Aihole (Bijapur district) 

while the óne called Ravalagudi is dedicated to Siva, dating about 

A.D. 700, the other one ofa slightly later date ís a Jain temple. 

Both are excavated into the low sandstone dutcrops, and mark the 

latest of the early Chalukyan or Western Chalukyan series in their 

home districts. Though smaller than the Badami cave-temples, 

these are interesting from the point of view of plan, design апа. 

sculpture. The pillars are more slender and have the usual capital 

components of the ‘order’. The Ravalagudi consists essentially of 

an almost square mandapa with a large principal cella of almost 

equal size on fhe rear, and two more, wide, lateral shrines, thus 

making a trikuta plan. While the rear shrine has a rock-cut linga, 

the lateral shrine on its right is dedicated to the Saptamatrikas and 

attendant deities, and the one on the left to other forms of Siva. 

The slightly projecting dividing wall-strips between the mandupa 

and rear shrine, leaving а wide entrance in between, carry the 

dvarapala sculptures. On the facade on either flank on the rock 

wall are niches containing the sculptures of the two nidhis— 

Sankha and Padma. The Jain cave-temple has a front mandapa 

which is more pronouncedly rectangular, and conforms, to the 

typical mandapa-type cave-temple pattern. 



The high trap-ridge at Ellora which had afforded the venue for 

a series of Buddhist excavations described earlier, now provided a 

scope for Hindu and Jain works. The Brahmanical cave-temples, 

occupying the central section of the hill and the parts higher up, 





LATER .ROCK. ARCHITECTURE · 69 





belong to the period of the Chalukyas and their Rashtrakuta 

successors. The Hindu excavations, designated as Caves 13 fo 29, 

are mostly Saivite in character and fall into two distinct chronolo- 

gical series, the earlier series being more after the models of the 

preceding Buddhist excavations characterised by’ the general 

absence of a rock-cut image or symbol like the Zinga in their 

sanctums. There are, of course, variations of plan and content in 

some. Cave 16 is the Kailasa complex, where the main part is the 

monolithic vimana temple of- Kailasa with cave-temples on the 

scarp of the circumambulatory passage as in the case of the Lankes- 

vara. (16a). The later series are more after the models of the south 

and often contain an image in their sanctum, a rock-cut linga 

pedestal with sometimes a rock-cut Nandi also. 



The pillars in these caves are of a varied nature and design and 

are square or octagonal in section, or, generally, of the kumbha- 

yalli type with full vases and excrescent foliage at the middle height; 

or they have cushion-shaped kumbha mouldings in their capitals. 

The corbels, where present, are either simple or ornate. The 

cornice, or kapota, over the facades and shrine-éntrances is decora- 

ted by horse-shoe-shaped kudus which are small nasikas. The door- 

frames have elaborate over-doors and carry, as the utfaranga on 

top, miniature representations of the southern vimana-type shrine 

or the northern sikhara or prasada shrines. The Ramesvara (Càve 

21) would represent the earliest of this group. The facade "of 

the rectangular mukha-mandapa has four short, bulky, ornate 

pilars, and two pilasters at either end rising above a highly 

decorated vedi parapet, or dwarf wall, interrupted in the middle 

between the two central pillars to provide the entrance doorway. 

The transverse length of the rectangular portico, Or mukha- 

mandapa, wbich is carried across the entire front of the excavation 

has further extensions, one at either end in the form of a side 

shrine or chamber. Behind the mukha-mandapa is the pillared 

maha-mandapa, the two central rows of pillars wider apart form- 

ing the nave, with the sandhara sanctum at the rear, while the 

extreme ones, which are closer to the central ones, form the aisles 





70 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





leading to the circumambulatory passage round the sanctum. The 

sanctum entrance is guarded by huge dvarapalas. The pillars have: 

the kumbha mouldings. In thé matter of shrine location, even 

with the modifications effected, it is yet in keeping with the 

Mahayana Buddhist shrines already excavated at Ellora. The 

exhibition of the bhuta gana friezes in the facade dwarf wall and 

the bracket figures, on the other hand, would take this excavation 

closer to the Badami group, thereby indicating the first quarter of 

the seventh century as its date. Caves 20, 22, 23 and 24, adjacent 

to this, would also belong to about the same period. 



The Ravana-ki-kai (Cave 14) is of a simpler plan, with a large 



pillared mandapa and a sandhara shrine at its rear. The doubling 

of the front row of columns affords a mukha-mandapa-like 

verandah in front of the nave leading to the shrine, the aisles con- 

tinuing as the circumambulatory passage round the shrine. The 

pillars are of the kumbha-valli type. Оп either side of the shrine- 

entrance, there are a number of carved images, including the two 

dvarapalas. On the mandapa walls, and carved in the recesses bet- 

ween the pilasters, are sculptural compositions, Saivite and Vaish- 

navite. The cella is rectangular and has provision for a platform 

on its rear with a socket in it for Vishnu or Durga, but not'for 

Siva or a linga. This excavation in the pre-Rashtrakuta series can 

be dated near A.D. 700. Besides the above, others like Caves 

17, 20, 21 and 26 are of the sandhara type and have their shrine 

chambers at the rear of the pillared mandapa cut out on all sides, 

resulting in a circumambulatory passage. Cave 17 should be 

nearer Ramesvara in point of time, i.e. the second quarter of the 

seventh century, and Cave 26 should approximate to the Rashtra- 

kuta excavations. 



The Dhumarlena, or Cave 29, is of the greatest interest since it 

is the largest and most imposing of the caves at Ellora. Its san- 

dhara and chaumukh, or chaturmvkha shrine, is not only isolated 

but also contained within a group of mandapas arranged in a 

cruciform plan which is simliar to that.of the Blephanta and the 

Jogeshvari caves. The four doorways of the shrine are fianked by 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 7 





large dvarapalas'and other accompanying sculptures. The long 

rectangular maha-mandapa or main hall that precedes the shrine 

and also partly surrounds it has a wide nave and aisles formed by 

а colonnade of five pillars on each side, of which the front enclo-. 

ses the main entrance. Additionally flanking the main hall are 

two lateral entrances through two portals or pillared transepts. 

The pillars are huge in size with kumbha or cushion capitals, 

and the statuary inside is also ponderous and of large proportions. 

The shrine contains a linga on a monolithic pitha. The cave-temple 

can be dated to the middle of the seventh century in the 

Chalukyan period. ‹ : 

Cave 27, or the Milkmaid’s cave (Gopilena), is, an- interesting 

example with triple shrines on the rear and side walls of the man- · 

dapa. Cave 25, or the Kumbharvada has multiple shrine-cells as 

in Bhokardan and has lateral galleries attached to the ante-cham- 

ber. While Cave 27 may be of the transitional period between 





the Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, Cave 25 should be earlier, 

datable to the second half of the seventh century. 



The Dasavatara, or Cave 15, is an odd example.in as muchas. it 

is the only two-storeyed cave-temple or cave-complex of a very 

large size. It is.apparently a case of reconditioning of what was 

all prepared and cut out for Buddhistic requirements. It would 

mark the earliest example of Rashtrakuta work at Ellora. Its front 

pavilion carries the inscription of Dantidurga (c. 752-756) and is 

an accomplished piece of contemporary rock architecture. The 

cave-temple will have to be placed in the mid-eighth century. The 

detached Nandi-mandapa is four-pillared with flights of steps at the 

front and the rear. The facade of the temple that rises beyond 





has its two storeys with two rows of pillars, one above the other, 

the pillars being square and reminiscent of the arrangement in the 

Tin-tal cave of Ajanta. The ground floor is á compartment with 

fourteen square pillars and the upper floor has the plan of a large 





pillared mandapa with central nave and.lateral aisles and & shrine 

with a Zinga at tbe rear. The linga-pitha is circular. The pillars are 

arranged in six rows of pine cach with two additional ones at the 





72 ‘TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





far end of the nave forming a vestibule in front of the shrine. The 



two pillars at the front of the vestibule are elaborately carved while 



the rest 'of the pillars are plain, square in section. The pilasters 

` along the walls enclose between them large sunk panels with fine 



group sculptures. Cave 16 is another example having a circular 

` linga-pitha in its shrine. 



The Lankesvara cave at the: upper level, to the right of the 

Kailasa monolith, is again a Rashtrakuta excavation, showing a 

reversion to the type with a sandhara shrine-cell at the rear of a 

pillared mandapa. It is compact and has a terminal Nandi pavilion 

and contains a very rich grouping of sculptures of great iconogra- 

phic value. . : 



The Ganeshlena constitutes over a score of cave-temples forming 

a group collectively numbered as Cave 21. Each unit consists of a 

mandapa having simple pillars and pilasters of square section with 

corbels of the Chalukyan type on the facade, and the shrine cham- 

berat the rear. The rear wall of the shrine has a relief of Mahesa- 

murti. In most cases there is a linga inserted into a monolithc 

circular pitha on the floor, and in one case there is a rock-cut лга 

as well. The shrine doorways have over-doors. These may be 

placed'just about A.D. 750 in the early years of the Rashtrakuta 

rule in Ellora. The Mahesamurti reliefs here are quite different in 

treatment and finish from the celebrated One at Elephanta and, 

unlike Elephanta, they are placed on the wall behind the Rashtra- 

kuta linga in thé main shrine. 



The Jain excavations (Caves 30 to 34) mark the last phase of 

activity in Bllora commencing from about A.D. “800 and continuing 

into the next century. They follow mostly' the earlier Hindu 

examples in plan and design, differing only in their sculpture and 

iconography. The Indra Sabha (Cave 32) and the Jagannath 



Sabha (Cave 33) standing close together, are both two-storeyed 

excavations, The Indra Sabha has in its open fore-court the Chau- 

mukh Jain monolithic temple. The rock faces on the sides of the 

open front quadrangle are profusely sculptured and have elabora- 

tely carved kapofa entablatures, one separating the lower from the 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 73 





upper storey with a lion and elephant series in the frieze, and the 

other, on top of the upper storey, with a series of shrines depicting 

Tirthankara forms. The lower storey of the cave is an unfinished 

hall mostly with simple pillars, some of them moulded. There are 

attempts to cut cells into the walls. The upper storey is again a 

navaranga-mandapa with twelve pillars, the central bay having a 





. raised platform for a Jain Chaumukh with the ceiling showing an 





elaborate lotus carving. The hall has a pillared portico, and there 

are two side shrines, projecting on either side of the front. 



The Jagannath Sabha, though of the same type, lacks the regu- 

larity of the plan. The ground floor is a complex of three asym- 

metrically disposed sanctuaries, each a complete unit, consisting of 

agra-and maha - mandapas. 'The rear shrines open into the court- 

yard which has crumbled away. The upper floor has the navaranga 

hall with twelve outer pillars as in the Indra Sabha, but there is 

also a shrine at the rear. From one corner of the mandapa and 

disposed at an angle is an additional unit similar in proportions 

and character to those of the ground floor, but complete and 

richly carved. i 



In Elephanta, a tiny island off Bombay, the cave-temple is dis- 

tinguished by the exceptional quality of its sculptures of which the 

great Mahesamurti is the most well known. With the main east- 

west linear axis of the excavation parallel to the length of the rock, 

its plan consists of a large mandapa supported by twenty pillars on 





‚ its periphery, eight ranged on each of the. longer sides and two 





each on the front and the rear, between the corner pillars. There 

are flights of steps in front of the shorter or front and rear sides, 

leading out into open courts on the respective sides, which are 

formed by cuttings that more or less isolate the section of the rock 

with its excavated cave-temple from the rest of the mass. In the 

eastern court on its floor is a circular rock-cut pedestal, perhaps 

for Nandi. The northern side of the main maha-mandapa has pro- 





‘jected mukha- and agra-mandapas. “The outermost agra-manaapa has 





two pillars and pilasters on its facades; the mukha-mandapa is longer 

than the former by the addition of one more bay at either end. 





74 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





These two are designed as the northern lateral extensions of the 

maha-mandapa with an entrance on the open side, while the corres- 

ponding lateral extension of the same plan on the south, dug into 

the parent rock, contains the niches of Mahesamurti and other 

sculptures, Towards the rear end of the maha-mandapa is’ a 

sandhara, chaturmukha shrine, square, and with doors framed by 

'elaborate over-doors on the four sides. Inside there is a large 

rock-cut linga pedestal, with its spout on the north, and with an 

inserted Zinga. In front of the shrine there is an inner pradakshina- 

mandapa between two rows of four pillars each, forming part of 

the circumambulatory passage round the shrine. A cutting into 

the rock on the east, beyond the northern portico, leads to the 

eastern fore-court and the, main entrance to the temple. On the 

southern side of this court, a smaller cave-temple for Durga is 

excavated into the scarp. A similar cutting at the western end 

beyond the northern portico leads into the court behind the main 

temple into the western scarp. Into this a smaller Siva cave-temple 

is cut, consisting of a square shrine with a mandapa in front. This 

cave-temple may have to be placed in the middle of the second 



"quarter of the seventh century, while Bllora Cave 29 (Dhumar- 

lena), which is to a large extent its copy, should be placed in the 

beginning of the last quarter of the same century. 





The Jogeshvari cave-temple in Salsette, near Bombay, which is^ 





excavated into an almost underground low trap outcrop, is larger 

in area than the Elephanta cave, but is essentially of the same 





type. Trenching on three sides all round a marked-area into the 

rock outcrop isolated a large rectangular mass on which the scarps 





for the excavation were prepared. At the eastern/and longer end a 

large gateway or mahadyara is carved with a central passage and 





flanking mandapas on either side, one of them enshrining Ganesa. 

The mahadvara leads into an open court and the eastern facade, 

which is an agra-mandapa with.a higher floor-leyel. The main part 





of the temple beyond consists of a square chaturmukha shrine 

surrounded by a pillared cloister "with six pillars on each side, 

counting. the corner ones too. This is surrounded again by an 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 75 





outer astylar cloister, or mandapa, with a lower floor-level enclosed 



by the rock walls on all sides except for an entrance each on the 

east and the west, and for. three on the south. The shrine here 

occupies a central position and its doorways are framed by elabo- 

rate over-doors. On the western side there is another agra-man- 

dapa, similar to the one on the east, which leads out and up thro-: 

ugh a narrow tunnel to the road beyond. On the southern side, 



the main mandapa leads through its three openings, with a fine 



over-door frame round the central one flanked by two intermedi- 

ate windows, to an extension on this side, which is in the form of 

an outer open mandapa with a row ef ten pillars and two pilasters 

on its southern facade. Outside this is a narrow open court, The 

rock wall beyond has incomplete or abandoned excavations of a 

smaller size, of which the one at the'extreme end is dedicated: to 

Siva. This has interesting pillars with caryatids on 'its facade. The 

original dedication of the main sanctum was to Siva, though the 

temple now enshrines a modern idol of a goddess. 



The Patalesvara (or Panchalesvar) caye on Jangli Maharaj Road 

in Poona, cut into a low trap rock, is unique in that it has a triple- 

shrine with common pradakshina round it, a circular front pavilion 

for Nandi, and a side shrine for Durga. The three shrine-cells were 

perhaps dedicated to the Hindu Trinity, the central one to Siva 

and the lateral ones to Brahma, and Vishnu. All these features 

would point to the second half of the eighth century as its date in 

the Rashtrakuta times. 



The Hindu cave at Mahur (Nander district) in Maharashtra has 

a sandhara-type of sanctum with two smaller ' transverse corridors 

in front and two smaller subsidiary shrines on the flanks. This is 

apparently a late plan after the model of Caves 17 and 21 of 

Ellora, and datable to the first quarter of the eighth century. It was 

perhaps a provincial contemporary of Dhumarlena of Ellora. There 

is an unfinished excavation by the side of the Siva cave. 



The cave at Bhokardan near Aurangabad bas five shrine-cells in 

a line behind the pillared rectangular mandapa at the rear of an 

open cutting in a low outcropping trap rock on the left ‘bank of 





76 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





the Kelna river-bed. Each cell has а door-opening. The mandapa 

has two bays, at the front and therear, forming mukha- and ardha- 

mandapas. The side walls of the mandapa are scooped into shallow 

curves with large figure sculptures. The dvarapalas are large-sized, 

:and there are sculptures of Anantasayi, Surya, Balarama, Mahisha- 

mardini, etc. It is not clear if this cave is of Western or Eastern 

Chalukyan authorship; it could even have been of mixed tradition. 

The.nature of the sculpture and other evidence indicate an Eastern 

-Chalukyan authorship in the mid-seventh century A.D. 



The: group of two adjacent cave-temples at Arvalem in Goa is a 

rare instance of excavation into the local laterite of the west coast 

overlooking a stream. Both are of simple features. One of them, 

the southern cave-temple, is a triple-celled unit containing in each 

unit a Zinga mounted on a rock-cut pitha. The linga forms in their 

symbolic aspect differ from one another and represent three differ- 

ent deities. The central linga is the normal Chalukyan-type Siva- 

linga; the one in the southern cella is a linga shaft surmounted. by 

a solar disc representing Surya or the sun-god, with an inscription 

‘below the disc specifically mentioning it as a Surya form. The linga 

shaft in the northern cell is-surmounted by a flat spear-head, or 

“sakti”, indicating that it presents Kumara or Kartikeya. It is an 

interesfing instance of Vishnu of the Trinity being replaced by 

Surya according to the Surya-Narayana concept, and Brahma by 

Brahmanya or Kartikeya, as in the Trimurti cave-temple at Maha- 

'balipuram. 



The most outstanding feature of the rock-cut cave art has been, 



from the Buddhist times, the dominance of: sculpture over archi- 

‘tecture. This was facilitated largely by the softness of the stone 

material and the urge to exploit spaces, as on the pillars, on the 

walls between pilasters, and even on the ceiling. The same-tendency 

resulted in large-scale paintings, as at Ajanta, Ellora and Badami. 



The “different god-forms sculptured are depicted often in the 



narrative or synoptic panels. They vary in size from very large- 

-sized individual figures, as the dvarapalas, Mahesamurti, etc. to 

-almost the size of cameos. In the earlier Western Chalukyan caves 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 77 





as.at Badami, Vishnu and Siva sculptures occur indiscriminately, 

while in the later ones they are well-nigh separated. The former 

type of caves show among the female deities only Durga, while 

the latter have the Saptamatrikas, Sarasvati, Gajalakshmi and 

Parvati. The latter category is also to be found in the Rashtrakuta 

caves along with a relapse to the admixture of Vaishnavite carv- 

ings, though to a lesser extent. While the Western Chalukyan 

sculpture is noted for clarity in form, pose and expression, the 

Rashtrakuta phase is characterised by crowded ornamentation with 

less emphasis on pose and expression and, what is more, a tendency 

to depict Puranic episodes, either in a synoptic or narrative form. 

The profusion of such didactic depictions compensates richly for the 

diminution of the aesthetic trends of the earlier phase. In the Saiva 

temples at least, tendencies of cult domination and the prescrip- 

tions of Agama are noticed. While the Western Chalukyan linga- 

pithas are mostly square, the Rashtrakuta linga-pithas, as in Ellora 

Caves 15 and 16, and the Ganeshlena caves arc circular. They are 

monolithic and form part of the live rock of the excavation. These 

contrast with the absence of linga-pithas іп the Pallava cave-temples 

where the advent of lingas ofthe prismatie;dharalinga type inserted 

into sockets in the floor, or of éven uniform circular section over 

the square lower part that goes into the socket, is of a later date 

than the cave-temple. The Chalukya-Rashtrakuta lingas are of a 

different type. It is only in the monolithic linga-pitha and linga of 

the Pandyan temples that we find square, circular, and even 

octagonal linga-pithas. _ 



While the Zinga symbolising Siva in his aniconic aspect with the 

‘characteristic linga-pitha, called avudaiyar is absent as organically 

rock-cut with the cave itself in the earlier stages of the Pallava 

cave-temples, they appear as integral rock-cut forms of the Pandya- 

Muttaraiyar series, coinciding chronologically with the later 

Pallava structural phase. But in the north of the Tamil country, in 

the Chalukya-Rashtrakuta cave-temples the presence of the rock- 

cut Jinga-pitha, though not always along with the linga on it, would 

suggest a continuity with the earlier prevailing trends in that area. 





78 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





For after the unique example of the urdhvalinga (phallic) form in 

Gudimallam (Chittoor district), lingas, many of them of the arsha 

(or naturally occurring type), inserted into sockets of linga-pithas 

have been found in the course of excavations of the river-side area 

in Nagarjunakonda of.the Ikshivaku times, followed by the 

recent finds of lingas in linga-pithas in the salvaged area of the 

river-valley projects in the Kurnool and Mahbubnagar districts of 

Andhra Pradesh. These linked up with such finds of an earlier 

period from Karvan (Kayarohana), associated with Lakulisa—the 

founder of the pasupata creed, would indicate the gradual spread 

of the linga cult southwards during tye centuries, reaching Tamil 





Nadu in the beginning of the eighth century A.D.. 

The iconographic forms noticed in the Badami group include, 





among Vaishnava forms, Varaha, Trivikrama, Narasimba, Ananta- 



sayin, Vaikunthanatha, Vishnu, and Vaishnavite legends and, 

Krishna-lila in friezes. The Siva forms are Tandavamurti, Harihara, 



and Ardhanari. Among the others are Ganesa, Kartikeya, Durga 



and Mahishamardini. At Aihole (Ravalapudi or Ravalagudi), we 



have Varaha, Harihara, Ardhanari, Gangadhara, Saptamatrikas, 



Mahishamardini and the two Nidhis. 



In the Chalukyan phase at Ellora are to be seen Ganesa, Karti- 

` keya, Sarasvati, Gajalakshmi, Saptamatrikas, Siva-Parvati legends 

in synoptic forms, Parvati's penance, Kailasa-tolana, Aksha-krida- 

murti, Kalyana Sundara, Andhakari, Siva-tandavas, Lakulisa, 

Siva-Lakulisa, Krishna, Balarma, Subhadra, Surya, Anantasayin. 

and Brahma. The Rashtrakuta phase in the same place is noted for 

such sculptures as Durga, Mahishamardini, Parvati-tapas, Kalyana 

Sundara, the Kailasa scene, Ardhanari Siva, Govardhanadhari, 

Kaliyadamana, Varaha, Narasimha, Lakshmi, Sarasvati, Ganesa 

and Kartikeya. The Ganesalena at Ellora depicts also the Shan- 

mata or six-fold cult of Surya, Vishnu, Siva, Kartikeya, Ganesa 

and Durga. : ó 



The Elephanta sculptures are almost the same as those in 

Dhumarlena (Ellora), with some additions, such as the Mahesa- 

murti and Sivayogi. Jogeshvari has Kartikeya, Lakshmi, Ganesa, 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE 79 





Saptamatrikas, Lakulisa and Kalyana Sundara. The Patalesvara at 

Poona has Gajalakshmi, Tripurantaka, Anantasayin, Lingodbhava 

and Andhakari. Mahur depicts Ardhanari, Gangadhara, Tripuran- 

taka, Ganesa, Kartikeya and Surya. 





THE EASTERN CHALUKYAN CAVE-TEMPLES OF 

COASTAL ANDHRA 





In the Andhra coastal region, excavated into the softer rocks on 

either bank of the Krishna in the territory of the Eastern Chaluk- 

yas of Vengi, there are over a dozen cave-temples. They are to be 

found in the hills of Vijayawada and Mogalrajapuram on the north 

bank, all in Krishna district, and in the hills of Undavalli, Pena- 

maga, and Sitaramapuram on the south bahk in Guntur district. 

"These cave-temples of Eastern Chalukyan authorship show indivi- 

dualistic characters in their lay-out, iconography and the scheme 

of the cella. They partake in some respects of the neighbouring 

Pallava modes, apart from their parental Chalukyan and northern 

inheritance. The remarkable feature of this series of cave-temples 

is the occurrence of a rock-cut pedestal socket at the base of the 

rear wall of the cella denoting the object of worship, whether it be 

the linga form of Siva, or à sculptured stele bearing the image of 

other gods inserted into the socket. In Bhairavakonda, the socket 

is cut in a sunken recess on the wall over the pedestal to take in 

the linga, or image. In respect of the cave-temples of the Eastern 

Chalukyas, the absence of Vishnuite carvings is notable as against 

what is found in the Western Chalukyan-Rashtrakuta group. 

Practically all the cave-temple are Saiva, or are dedicated to other 

deities of the Saiva pantheon. The only exception is the aberrant 

Undavalli.cave-temple which is dedicated to Vishnu. The Nandi 

in Saiva cave-temples is rock-cut as in the Pandyan examples 

farther south. In point of time the Akkanna-Madanna cave at 

Vijayawada in its present form comes first. It is ascribable to the 

middle of the seventh century, and is closely followed by Caves I 

to IV of Mogalrajapurani, the lower cave-temple at Vijayawada, 





80 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





the Undavalli -and other caves in a series, ending with the: 

Bhairavakonda group datable to the middle of the eighth century. 

The last if not of direct Eastern Chalukyan vintage, can at-best be: 

of Telugu-Choda authorship. 



These cave-temples essentially consist of a rock-cut hall, or 

mandapa, with one or more, often three, shrine-cells behind. The 

multiple shrines are in a row at the rear. The mandapa is in some 

cases astylar and in others multi-pillared, or demarcated into front 

and rear sections by two rows of pillars and pilasters—the usual 

facade row and the parallel inner row. The pillars are usually 

simple, thick-set, short and square in section throughout, or have 

their middle height bevelled . at the corners. This results in the 

middle section being octagonal, while the basal and apical sections 

are square in plan. The cornice of the facade, the kapota, is decora- 

ted by kudu, or nasika arches. The doorways of the shrines are 

simple. like those in the southera cave-temples, and unlike the 

Western Chalukyan-Rashtrakuta types with elaborate over-doors. 

The doorway is often enclosed by two flanking pilasters carrying 

a torana festoon above. While most of the cave-temples are dedica- 

ted to Siva, two are definitely dedicated to Durga, and a few to 

Vishnu. The sculptural content is very meagre compared to the 

examples at Badami, Aihole, Ellora, etc. Among the few sculptures, 

mention.may be made of Tandava-Siva. The Anantasayanagudi 

cave-temple at Undavalli is the largest of the group and is a three- 

storeyed structure akin to the Ellora Buddhist Caves 11 and 12, 

the Do-tal and Tin-tal. It belongs to the seventh century if not 

earlier, and was perhaps intended originally for the Buddhist creed, 

but was adopted later fora Vishnu temple, the principal deity 

being a recumbent Vishnu, or Anantasayin. 



The Bhairavakonda cave-temples are excavated into a soft Schist 

intrusion in the hills at Kottapalle in Nellore district, а rock 

material different from the Krishna-Guntur group. Interposed 

between them, along with two rock sculptures of dancing Siva and 

Harihara, are small niches or memorial shrines with lingas cut inside 

them, with dedicatory or other inscriptions of the eighth century. 





LATER ROCK ARCHITECTURE : 81

The eight larger cave-terhples fall into two groups. The first four, 



starting from the northern end of the horse-shoe valley or ravine, 

are simple shrine excavations without a front mandapa and lack 

the elaborately decorated kapota cornice and its kudu ornaments. 



The cave-temples of the second group are of the regular type 



having an outer mandapa with a facade row of two pillars and two 

pilasters and a rear shrine-cell. The mandapa facade has on top a 

fully formed kapota with kudus as in the Mamalla-style cave- 



temples of the Pallavas. The pillars are square in section and of the 

Chalukyan pattern as found in the cave-temple on the banks of 

the Krishna. In some the pillars have lion caryatids on top and 

are also lion-based, with capital components above.as in the 



Mamalla-style cave-temples. The shrine-entrances are plain and 

without any over-door. These mixed characters and other features, 

as also the presence of relief sculptures of Brahma and Vishnu in 

the mandapa, provision for a linga in the shrine, and the presence 

of other sculptures like Chandesa and Ganesa, and the rock-cut 

Nandi, would indicate their non-Pallava origin and their date as 

being the middle of the eighth century. 





CHAPTER V 

ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 





THE MONOLITHIC VIMANAS — RATHAS 





THE MONOLITHIC vimana shrines cut out entirely from live rock are 

the most outstanding contributioh to rock architecture by Pallava 

Narasimhavarman Mamalla (630-668). These are in fact large 

sculptures of architectural models carved out of sectioped masses 

of standing rocks, or out of entire” boulders of the intractable 

granite gneiss rocks of Mahabalipuram. The germ of the idea of 

cutting out an entire temple form lies in tbe carved out stupas in- 

side the rock-cut chaitva halls of western India. The idea was 

further elaborated by the Buddhists in the large hypaethral stupa 

forms at Sankaram (Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh). An 

early, if imperfect, monolithic shrine form is found in the Tawa 

cave at Udaigiri (Vidisha district, Madhya Pradesh). It is more 

or less a circular monolithic temple cut out of an isolated mass of 

sandstone tock and carved into a hemisphere mounted on a base 

and capped by a flat stone in the form of a tawa (griddle) which, 

according to the inscription on it, was fashioned by a minister- of 

Chandragupta. 



What is more interesting is the fact that the Pallavas translated 

into the hard imperishable stone monoliths the various forms of 

structural vimana temples of brick-and-timber that were prevalent i 

at the commencement of the seventh century. These stone copies 

have survived these thirteen centuries, while their brick-and-timber 

originals, and their contemporary and later counterparts of the 

samefabric have totally perished. Thus they stand out as the 

earliest examples. of the beginnings of vimana architecture in the 

south, and exhibit the varieties of vimanas that existed, or were 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 83 





evolved at that time. The variety in form, namely, plan and rise, 

exemplified by these monoliths, locally called the rathas, would 

also indicate the existence of well-defined codes and manuals on 

rituals, art and architecture—the Agama, Silpa and Vastu Sastras. ~ 

They thus form the” most important landmarks in the study of 

Indian temple architecture, especially of the south. 



As entirely gut-out models, these monoliths show not only the 

entire external aspect-of a vimana from the base to the apex, with 

the front ardha-mandapa constituting a unitary type of the temple 

form, but also, to a large extent, as in the cave-temples, the interior 

aspects. They were all carved down from the apex to the base 'as 

opposed to structural constructions that are built up from the base, 

or foundation, to the apex. As, however, according to the tradi- 

tional ritual the installation of the stupi, or finial, should coincide 

with the consecration of the temple, after ceremonial installation 

of the archa murti, or image of worship in the sanctum, the pra- 

tishtha and kumbhabhishekam rituals, the stupi was not cut out 

initially and the work on these monoliths started from the member 

next below, viz. the sikhara, and a separately carved sfupi was 

inserted into position later on. As an alternative, sufficient rock 

material was left uncarved initially at the top, to be finished into 

the stupi at the end of the work. 



The carving of these monolithic vimanas, all confined to Maha- 

balipuram, seems to have continued for at least two generations 

after Mamalla, that is, till about A.D. 700 when, perhaps, sculptures 

in bas-relief of the principal deities were carved in the sanctuaries 

of two of these vimanas—the Draupadi Ratha and the top storey 





of the Dharmaraja Ratha. The earlier practice was to have painted 

stucco forms of the principal deity inside the sanctum. 





THE VIMANA TEMPLE 





Since the vimana form is the most characteristic and distinctive 

feature of the southern temple as opposed to the characteristic 

| Prasada temple of north and central India, it would be useful in 





84 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





this context to define it briefly and understand its general features, 

as also the variations of its form, plan ard rise. ‘Such a general 

understanding of the fundamentals of the southern vimana temple 

would be necessary, for it may not be practicable to describe in 

detail the temples that follow in the-seguel, except highlighting 

their most outstanding features. 

The term vimana, according to all the early and most of the later 

Silpa and Agama works, as also many contemporary inscriptions, 

would denote the entire edifice from the upana or lowermost 

moulding of the-adhishthana, or pedestal, to the stupi, or the top- 

most finial. It is not the superstructure over the sanctum alone, as 

is often assumed by many writers and in a few late texts. It has 

often а small vestibule in front called the ardha-mandapa or anta- 

rala, standing on the same basement, or adhishthana. The earliest 

examples of the southern temple were of the unitary type consist- 

- ing of the vimana, siagle or multi-storeyed, with its ardha-mandapa 

surrounded by the enclosure wall, the prakara. The early southern 

texts also deal mainly with vimana which, though attaining con- 

siderable stature in elevation, was in actual lay-out remarkably 

rudimentary and compact in character. Subsequently, a stage came 

when a simple maha-mandapa was added in front of the ardha- 

mandapa. and was well integrated with the main. parts, the whole 

often surrounded by an enclosure wall, the prakara. The entrance, 

another characteristic storeyed.structure of the south, was called 

the dvarasobha, mahadvara, or gopura, according to its stature and 

magnitude. Often the additional mandapa was an unattached auxi- 

liary structure standing separately in the fore-court inside the pra- 

kara. The stature of the main vimana, with its adjunctthe ardha- or 

mukha-mandapas, was increased by the addition of a platform, the 

upa-pitha, below the adhishthana. 'Yhe upa-pitha is, however, descri- 

'bed in the texts as an optional member. We have to understand 

that the functional importance of the shrine was directly, propor- 

tional to its spatial extent. The gods and goddesses other than the 

principal form enshrined in the main sanctum had to. be accom- 

modated largely in two dimensional niches, or devakoshthas, on the 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 85 





vimana and ardha- and maha-mandapa walls, and the falas or 

storeys of the superstructure. The rest of the figure sculpture was 

accommodated even on the pillars of the mandapa. With the, 

increasing importance and elaboration of rituals and multiplication 

of festivals, additions, both axial and peripheral, were made to 

this nuclear structure. These took the form of auxiliary mandapas 

on the axial line and subsidiary shrines or vímanas, mandapas 

(halls), and malikas or cloisters, surrounding the central unit. The 

whole was enclosed by one or more prakaras, with one or more 

gopura entrances, resulting in the familiar temple complex of south 

India. These additions were sometimes coeval with the main unit. 

In cases, like the Brihadisvara at Thanjavur, the entire temple 

complex was planned and designed at the same time and executed 

almost simultaneously. More often, however, it is the result of 

gradual additions duringivarious periods, thus successively enlarging 

the original lay-out and resulting in such larger temple complexes, 

ortemple cities, as those at Chidambaram,. Tiruvannamalai, 

Madurai and Srirangam. 



The temple cities, so called, such as Srirangam, which is the 

largest of the lot, accommodate the residential houses of people 

connected with the temple inside of the outer circuits. In Srirangam, 

for example, where the primary temple nucleus of Ranganatha 

(Vishnu-recumbent) is surrounded by seven concentric prakaras or 

enclosure walls, the inner four walls invest the various subsidiary 

shrines and festival mandapas while the outer three walls have 

residential houses and mansions ranged along their inside faces, 

which are also called maikai (malika). These along with other 

houses and streets outside the outermost seventh prakara, 

constitute a modern municipal town. 



As in all three-dimensional constructions where the plan and 

elevation aspects count, it is the diverse nature of the plan, and the 

degree of rise, involving the elaboration of the number of talas or 

storeys—the talachchhanda, as it is called—that result in the great 

variety of southern vimanas leading to their differentiation: and 

classification into categories. The f our-sided square or oblong plans, 





86 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





and the curvilinear—circular, elliptical and aspidal plans—became 

familiar even in the earlier Buddhist and non-Buddhist temples. 

But the bexagonal or octagonal plan that is found introduced in 

the make-up of the southern vimana would be rather uncommon. 

In the matter of rise the simple or ekatala vimana consists es- 

sentially of six vertical components, which, from base to apex, 

would be (1) the adhishthana, or basement, (2) the pada, or pillar, 

or the bhitti, or wall, according as the structure stands on either 

or both of these supports enclosing the sanctum, (3) the prastara 

or architrave, with the prominent cornice, ог kapota, (4) the griva 

or clerestory over. sanctum terrace and entablature, (5) the sikhara 

or ultimate roof covering the top of the clerestory or griva and (6) 

the sfupi or fmial crowning the top of the sikhara. Such a simple 

structure, or alpa vimana, is said to be ekatala, or single-storeyed, 

and is shadanga or shadvarga, ie. insix parts. The addition of 

another tala to its body part, or harmya, and architrave or prastara 

of smaller dimensions than the ground floor as in interpolation 

between the prastara ofthe ground floor and the griva-sikhara- 

stupi components above, would make the vimana a dvitala one, or 

two-storeyed, with eight angas, the additions being the harmya and 

prastara of the second tala. Such ashtanga vimanas were more 

common in fhe earlier stages. The number of storeys could be in- 

creased to three or four (tritala, chatushtala), etc. jn which case 

they were called jati vimanas. The larger vimanas with panchatala 

and more storeys reaching up to sixteen, are mentioned in the Silpa 

texts as mukhya vimanas. A case in point is the great Brihadisvara — . 

Vimana of Thanjavur, which rises to a height of over 60 metres. 

The most characteristic .and general feature of the southern 

vimana is the presence of a string of miniature vimana-like shrines 

on top of each storey, above the prastara set on its periphery, and - 

surrounding the body, or harmya, of the next fala. Such a string 

is called the hara. While a Agra is not prescribed for the ekatala . 

alpa vimanas of the [simple type, ‘the jati and mukhya vimanas are 

provided with such haras. In the earlier examples dating up to 

about A.D. 700, the hara is found on top of all the talas of the'

multi-storeyed vimana, including the topmost fala where it sur- 

rounds the griva. In later cases the hara on the topmost tala is 

absent. Its place is taken by the vahanas, or vehicles, or lanchanas, 

that is, cognizant symbols appropriate to the principal deity 

enshrined in the sanctum of the aditala. They are Nandis or 

bhutas in Siva temples, lions in Devi, Vishnu or Jain temples, 





Garuda in Vishnu temples, and so on. This became an invariable 

feature of the southern temples from this period onwards. Thus 

the credal or denominational character and the type of the con- 

secration of a temple can be recognised even from a distance from 

the nature of the vahanas, or lanchanas placed on the topmost tala. 



According to the plan—four-sided, polygonal or curvilinear— 

the southern vimanas are classified in the southern Silpa and 

Agama texts as Nagara, Dravida and Vesara. That which is four- 

sided, square or oblong, from the base to the finial, or has a four- 

sided griva and sikhara, is classified as Nagara. That which is 

hexagonal or octagonal from the base to the finial; or has a hexa- 

gonal or octagonal griva or sikhara, is termed Dravida. The one 





which is circular, ellipsoidal or apsidal from base to top, or has 

such a plan in its griva and sikhara, is Vesara. While generally the 





uniform square or oblong plan is met with making up a pure 

form of Nagara, in many cases the griva and sikhara may assume 

the octagonal, or circular, or apsidal plan over a square body 

constituted by the tadifala, or the series of talas in simple or multi- 

storeyed examples. This would make such vimanas Dravida or 

Vesara of the mixed variety. Likewise, the oblong body may carry 

an elliptical griva and sikhara, which would make the vimana 

Vesara again. Thus, more than the shape of the basal parts or 

body, it is the plan of the griva sikhara components that really 

matters in this type of classification. 



The square, circular, hexagonal or octagonal structure which 

has а sikhara that is domical and ends up in a single’ finial, ог 

stupi, is called kuta vimdna with kuta sikhara. The oblong and 

ellipsoidal body structures with a wagon-top, vault-like or inverted 



iboarlike roof, or sikhara with a row of stupis on top along the 





88 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





ridge, are known as sala vimanas, or koshtha, or sabha forms. The 

chapa, ог apsidal structure which has an apsidal roof and a series 

of finials along the horizontal part is generally called the hasti- 

prishtha, or gaja-prishtha, since it resembles the hind view of a 

standing elephant. It comes in the category of panjaras or nidas. 

The Zara, or string of diminutive shrines on top of the alas of 

multi-storeyed vimanas, is composed of these three classes of ,` 

shrine forms—the miniature kuta, sala (or koshtha), and panjara 

(or nida). These are placed at the corners and along the sidês on 

the top edges of the tala, and are interconnected by lengths of 

cloister-like or parapet-like parts of lesser height than the kuta, 

kostha and panjara elements, called the karantara. These harantara 

cloister lengths have lateral bay-window-like projections with a 

lower rectangular component Or window proper, projected from 

the wall of the cloister, and an arched dormer, the upper com- 

ponent, projected from the coping roof of the harantara cloister. 

These are called kshudra nasikas, since they 'are smaller than 

similar projections from the sides of the main griva sikhara part 

of the vimana which are the maha nasikas and originally function- 

ed as ventilators. It will be seen that the hara in most of the 

Mamalla-style cave-temples is a string of oblong salas alone, and 

the kutas at the extremes of each side, coinciding with the corners 

and hence called karnakutas, areto be found for the first time in 

the Pancha-Pandava cave-temple. While the salas along the lengths 

of each side and the karnakutas at the corners are found in most 

of the monolithic vimanas, the nida or panjara as the third element 

of the hara makes its appearance only in two cases, namely, Over 

the first tala of the Dharmaraja Ratha and the second fala of the 

Nakula-Sahadeva Ratha completed towards the close of the 

seventh century. Though this is not repeated in the alpa vimanas 

with one, two or three talas of the structural phase, both of the 

Chalukyas and the Pallavas, the mida appears as an invariable 

constituent of the larger jali and mukhya vimanas from the eighth 





century onwards. P 

The hara may stand apart from the central harmya of the tala 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE $9 





that it surrounds, leaving a narrow circumambulatory passage in 

between as in the Dharmaraja Ratha where all the talasare intend- 

ed to be functional, each with a cella. Such a hara is said to be 

anarpita. This scheme of a ring of miniature shrine motifs round 

the central body of each storey would be after a similar lay-out 

plan at ground level, of a central shrine surrounded by subsidiary 

or purivara shrines and would denote that it is schematically 

carried up at every storey level. This scheme of anarpita hara was 

possible in the case of vimanas where the cella was sandhara, or 

enclosed by a double wall, with circumambulatory interspace 

between the two walls and with the inner wall rising to a greater 

height to form the second tala harmya, While the outer wall rose to 

the height of tbe aditala alone carrying over its prastara and hara. _ 

By further extension of this principle, the number of concentric 

walls round the aditala sanctum could be three, resulting in 2 

three-storeyed vimana, the outermost wall rising to the height of 

the aditala, the middle one to the height of the second tala, and 

the innermost one to the height of the third tala, with horizontal 

separations at each tala height forming a system of three super- 

posed garbha-grihas arranged one over the other, with deities 

inside them. 



Though a few such vimanas are to be found built from the 

Pallava times onwards, a universal extension ofthe scheme in all 

cases of vimanas of the mukhya class would have resulted in 

ponderous, squat edifices of uncouth proportion of base and height; 

the former much larger in area as compared to the height. The 

solution was to design massive walls round the aditala sanctum 

which could rise to heights and bear the load and make the upper 

tales schematic or non-functional storeys with the haras coalescing 

with the tala harmya wall, thus eliminating the inte: ning circum- 

ambulatory space. Such а hara was called arpita, and the vimana 

with such a single wall round the cella in its aditala was known as 

nirandhara. All this was actuated by the desire to construct vima- 

nas of impressive loftiness on comparatively smaller base areas. 



The quadrature or the sides of the aditala in the case of 





90 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





four-sided, polygonal, circular or apsidal structures, could be 

broken by offset projections or bays at intervals, starting from the 

lowermost part of the adhishthana. This scheme could be carried up 

to the talas above also, resulting in a scheme of bays at the corners 

and along the sides, with intervening recesses. The projected bays 

are denoted. as the ratha projections in the northern-style temples 

and are described as tri ratha, pancha ratha, sapta ratha, etc. 

according as the offset bays on each side of the square are three, 





five or seven. The nomenclature is not applied to these parts in the 

southern vimanas. The bays here are called bhadras. They are can- 





toned by pilasters at their outer corners. On their inner angles with 

the.adjacent walls, and over the prastara region, likewise offset, 

they carry the members of the, hara—kuta, sala or panjara, as the 

case may be. The corner ones, equal-sided and square carry the 

kutas of the lara which invariably occupy the corners and are aptly 

called karnakutas. The bays on each face of the vimana coming 

between the corner ones are wider when they carry the salas of the 

hara over their prastara. In between these two the third type of 

projections would be the narrowest since they carry the panjara or 

nida element of the hara over their prastara. These occur only in 

the larger jati and mukhya vimanas. These bays, particularly the 

wider ones with the sala on top, have niches sunk into them 

between the cantoning pilasters over the level of the adhishthana 

and below the kapota of the prastara. These are occupied by figure 

sculptures and are called devakoshthas. The intervening recesses 

between the bays. represent the wall proper of the tala and are 

generally without sculpture in the earlier examples. They have only 

the pilasters, but some later Ones have sculpture panels too, even 

- shallow niches, or decorative type of pilaster motifs. 

The. pillars and pilasters conform more or less to their wooden 

originals with moulded ‘capitals’, or tops, which comprise the 

“order as.it is termed in architectural parlance. The shaft has a 

base or pedestal, the oma, and has on its top a band of lotus petals 

with & scheme of loops of garlands hanging down. This part called 

malasthana and padma bandha marks the top end of the shaft and 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE ` 9i 





the beginning of the capital which consists of moulded parts, a 

pitcher, lasuna or kalasa, placed over the padma bandha, a saucer- 

shaped part called tadi, a flattened. bulbous or cushion-shaped 

member over if called the kumbha carrying an inverted platter- 

Shaped part, and a doucine moulding, called the pali (or padma 

when itis shaped to simulate an inverted lotus blossom with: 

petals) which really forms the underside of a plank-like abacus— 

the phalaka. The phalaka, large, thick and square'in earlier forms, 

became polygonal or circular and thinner and smaller in:later 

temples. It supports the corbel-bracket or block, potika, which 

carries the beam, or uttira. The oma, or pillar base, is often shaped 

or transformed into a figure sculpture of an animal, real or my- 

thical, or of a celestial being. Thus there are the squatting or 

rearing vyalas (mythicallion-like forms with transformed faces), 

elephants, magas, naga-deyas, bhutas, etc. The pillar shaft, as also 

the capital components, except the phalaka (which remains always 

square in earlier forms), may, instead. of being four-sided or square, 

have six, eight, sixteen or more sides, or be circular in section. The: 

potikas assume various. shapes, like the taranga potikas of the: 

Pallava cave-temples or the simple bevelled ones in others. They 

later develop a central projecting tenon, or ‘double volute, or 

assume the shape of a projecting curved arm terminated by a 

pendentive lotus bud, the pushpa potikas of the temples of the: 

fifteenth century and later. These shapes indicate regional develop- 

ments and also chronological evolution. 



Another important architectural feature is the torana which i is 

essentially an arched festoon (occasionally straight as in the 

foranas of Sanchi), mounted over two columns and marking а. 

sacred or ceremonial entrance. Such free-standing forana entrances 

or stambha toranas are stated to have preceded the gopura entrances 

of ancient palaces. But while the entrance forana hàs been retained: 

in the northern monuments, as at Sanchi and Bhubanesvar, it is. 

the gopura entrance that has prevailed in the south and forms the 

most characteristic and invariable part of the temple complex. The: 

torana idea is, however, not lost; the motif is applied to тапу: 





92 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





niches and entrances on.the-body of the vimana or the gopura and 

are known as bhitti toranas: Their supporting columns are of the; 

same type as the pillars or pilasters with the capital components.. 

From the mouths of opposed makaras perched on top-of the: 

phalaka or abacus are sprung the arched festoons of flowers and 

foliage, or friezes of animals, ganas and other forms. Such toranas 

are accordingly called patra toranas, chitra toranas, vidyadhara , 

toranas, etc. These are found to frame the entrances of some cave-: 

temples, the fronts of the niches, or devakoshthas, on the walls of | 

the vimana, and the fronts of the nasikas of various orders and 

sizes—the maha nasika, the sukanasika, the kshudra nasika, and 

the alpa nasika. The gable-window-like arched kudu ornaments on 

the kapota. of the prastara are fronted by toranas bereft of the 

supporting columns. : 



The adhishthana, or pedestal, is also variable. In its simplest and 

most primary form it would consist of an offset bottom course, the 

upana, a taller neck-like recessed vertical course, the kantha, and a 

top projecting platform, the prati or pattika. Such a one is called a 

mancha: A slight elaboration would be the insertion of a torus 

moulding called the kumuda which is three-faceted (tripatta), or 

rounded (vitta) and placed above the kantha and below the 

pattika, having another plain moulding, less offset than the upana 

but taller and coming over it, called the jaguti. A third variant 

would be the one with the addition of a flexed kapota or cornice 

below the pattika region. A jagati or kumuda may also be placed 

over a series of lotus petals shown as spread over the upana. These 

in earlier periods indicate regional forms and show elaboration in 

later forms. ; z 



Different combinations of adhishthana forms, the number of 

talas in the talachchhanda. variations of the hara components 

between the karnakutas, their alternate or opposite position in the 

successive, talas, their number and other features gave rise to diffe- 

rent types of vimanas às classified in detail in the Silpa and Agama 

texts and as found among thousands of temples in the south. 



While the unitary type of the southern temple in its simplest 





А 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 93 





-form consisted merely of the vimana proper enclosing the garbha- 

griha, with a porch-like antarala or ardha-mandapa, with the growth 

of the Agama and rituals, elaboration set in. Mandapas, such as the 

maha-mandapa, mukha-mandapa, agra-mandapa, etc. were added 

axially, and soon peripherally also like the utsava snapana and . the. 

sabha-mandapas. 'The mandapas of the southern temples are all flat- 

roofed, however long or large they may be. Occasionally опе finds 

them slopy-roofed if the local climatic conditions so demand as, 

for instance, on the west coast and the extreme tip of the penin- 

sula. This is in; sharp contrast to what obtains in the nothern 

prasada temples whether of Gujarat, Orissa or central India. 

There, one invariably finds pyramidally rising or tiered superstruc- 

tures terminating in a finial over the roofs of the mandapa in the 

axial or transverse line of the main prasada, the superstructures 

being of the ghantasamavarana type, or its simplified pitha pida type. 

Though this scheme gives a distinct sky-line of successively ascend- 

ing finials from the top of the foremost or outermost mandapa to 

that of the main sikhara of the prasada, it does make a rather 

heavy cluster of towers and necessitates also the main sikhara, 

superstructure over the prasada sanctum to be relatively much 

higher than that of the mandapas. The flat roof of the mandapas, 



which are mere adjuncts to the main vimana of the southern temple, 

allows always the vimana which is the most important and domi- 

-nating entity to stand clear against the sky-line. 



The mandapas, very rarely astylar inside, are mostly supported 

on pillars and are closed or open on the sides. When closed they 

have. a series of pilasters against the inner faces of the walls. On 

their outer faces the external scheme obtaining in the main vimana 

is followed. The pillars are mostly of the simple type, with the top 

and bottom sections square on plan and with the intervening sec- 

tion octagonal or polygonal, as in the case of the southern rock- 

cut cave-temples which, on that account, are popularly: called 

mandapa-temples. The names Kotikal mandapam, Orukal manda- 

pam, Idaichi mandapam, etc. indicate this. Additional square sec- 

tions are also interposed in the middle region in the case of tall 





194 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





pillars. Such simple mandapa pillars do not have differentiated 

capital mouldings, but bear the potika or corbel block directly over 

the top square section. They may occasionally have the full 

capitals of the-order or, as in the case of the cave-temples of the 

Deccan, they may be of the kumbha-valli type or have the so-called 

‘cushion capitals mentioned earlier. In later mandapas of the 

' Chalukyan series, the pillars above their square base are rendered 

into a series of curved and rounded shapes by being turned on a 

lathe. In later mandapas of the Pallava-Pandya series, the pillars 

have attached portrait statues, animal fipures or a number of 

,columnettes called ani-yotti-k-kal. 



Though the rudiments of the plan of the mandapa are to be seen 

in ‘the rock-cut caves and їп the remains from Nagarjunakonda, 

their patterns became móre distinct in the stone-and-brick temples 

of the ‘seyenth century onwards. In the Chalukya-Rashtrakuta 

Series in the Deccan and in those that took after them and succeed- 

ed them, the mandapa is of two patterns. In the first case it is divid- 

ed into a central nave with a raised roof over taller pillars, or with 

clerestory, arid two lateral. aisles with lower roofs. In the second 

pattern the mandapa is essentially square, being eleborated all round 

concentrically by the addition of peripheral rings of the same short 

squat pillars as the central ones. With four central pillars standing 

on the corners of a central square and twelve peripheral pillars or 

pilasters sét up at equal distances, in axial transverse and diagonal: 

alignment with the central ones, a system of eight bays surround- 

ing the central bay (making in all nine bays) would result in the 

mandapa becoming a mavaranga. The addition of twenty more 

‘pillars as a still outer ring in alignment with the inner onés and 

at the corners would correspondingly increase the number of 

bays to twenty-five and make the mandapa a larger square. The 

Pallava-Pandya series of temples, and what followed them 

in material, technique and tradition in the succeeding periods 

in the farther south, elaborated the shape from the square to 

the oblong by emphasizing linear rows of taller pillars with wider 

spans. All this resulted in such multi-pillared mandapas as the 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 95 





bundred-or thousand-pillared halls. i 5 

Till about thë commencement of the eleventh century, the 

gopuras, or storeyed gateways, piercing the protective prakara, or 

enclosure wall, çharacteristic of the southern temples, were built 

comparatively smaller than the vimana. They are essentially oblong 

on plan; transversely linear, with the entrance running tbrough at 

the middle, and; with .a single simple or storeyed superstructure, 

terminated by a sala sikhara with a row of stupis. The talachch- 

handa, or system of.storeys, with hara components at each level, is 

much akin to that of the oblong, or ayatasra vimana. In the earlier 

series of temples mostly the alpa and jati vimanas prevailed. The: 

larger temples, with jati vimanas included in their lay-out scheme 

the gopuradvara, or main gateway entrance, which was of consi- 

derably smaller proportions and height than the main vimana that 

always dominated the entire composition. These small and middle 

size gopuras were single- ог two- or :three-storeyed ‘called dyara- 

sobha, dvarasala, dvaragopura, etc. From the close of the tenth 

century onwards when larger vimanas came to be constructed, the 

gateway came to assume correspondingly larger proportions, be- 

coming many-storeyed and called maltadvara, or gopura, or raja- 

gopura. The gateways also tended to increase in height and size, 

ultimately to become the dominating structures of the temple com- 

plex. This could be seen particularly in the case of those ancient 

temples where the main vimana nucleus that was ancient was kept 

intact and the prakara and gopura adjuncts came to be successively 

added round it in later timesas in the Chidambaram, Tiruvanna- 

. malai, Madurai and Srirangam temple complexes. There was thus a 

shift in emphasis from the main vimana in the. gopura, with the 

result that while in the earlier temple complexes, as in the Briba- 

disvara temple at Thanjavur, the sky-line.descends from the stupi 

of the main vimana to-tlíé-outer-of the two front gopuras built 

almost in the:same period as the main vimana, it ascends from the 

centre to the outermost gopura in the four temple complexes men- 

tioned above. t

THE MONOLITHIC VIMANA FORMS 





While the Chalukyas of Badami started constructing structurat 

temples of the very tractable sandstone closely following their 

earlier excavated rock-cut cave-temples in the same type of rock, 

the Pallavas were faced with a very hard and intractable material 

—the granites and charnockites. Besides carving out a few vimana: 

forms as miniature reliefs or full-scale facades, they also started 

carving out three-dimensional monolithic vimanas of normal 

stature, and of diverse kinds. This was a sequel to the experience 

they gained in the cutting in of cave-temples in hard stone. Such 

pioneering work of making cut-out vimana temples was inaugurated 

by Mamalla (Narasimhavarman 1—630-668), and the monoliths 

were taken to different degrees of finish. New ones were created ‘by 

his successors, Mahendravarman 1I (668-672) and Paramesvara- 

varman 1 (672-700), and also perhaps by Rajasimha (700-728) in 

his early years before he started the vogue of constructing struc- 

tural temples. There are nine such monolithic vimanas, popularly 

called rathas, and named after the Pandava group as usual in folk 

tradition, all confined to Mahabalipuram, in various stages of 

completion and representing different forms. It will be useful to 

consider along with these the eight miniature: bas-relief represent- 

ations of vimanas found in the same place, as also the full-scale 

.example of the Trimurti cave-temple facade, since they taken to- 

gether would illustrate various forms of the southern vimana, 

Incidentally they constitute the earliest representations copied in 

stone from the contemporary and earlier brick-and-timber vimanas. 

Thus these stone replicas would afford a good starting point for 

the study of the south Indian temple architecture. More so because 

these faithfully reproduce in stone not only the various forms in 

general but also the individual parts, even to the minutest detail, 

of timbering, fastening, metal work and decorative design appro- 

priate to the various forms of the brick-and-timber originals. 



The bas-relief miniature found in the famous Arjuna's Penance 

scene in Mahabalipuram ‘is а typical replica of an ekatala 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 97 





alpa vimana with all the six angas or parts, viz. the adhishthana 

(moulded base), pada, or bhitti (pillars or walls), prastara (entabla- 

ture with kapota or cornice), griva (neck or clerestory), sikhara 

(roof), and stubi (finial). Being four-sided and square from base to 

finial,it belongs to the Nagara class and is dedicated to Vishnu, 

who is shown in relief as standing inside the cella. The reproduc- 

tion of the parts of the wooden original is quite obvious. The two 

bas-relief replicas in miniature on either flank of the facade of the 

Ramanuja mandapam cave-temple are likewise ekatala, Nagara 

forms, but with their cella empty. Their adhishthana stands over a 

larger moulded platform, which would form the upa-pitha, an 

optional member, often introduced in the design to elevate the 

height of a vimana. 



A similar bas-relief miniature of an ekatala vimana of a hexago- 

mal section from base to apex is depicted inside the front sikhara 

arch (torana mukhapatti) of the apsidal Nakula-Sahadeva Ratha. 

This with a uniform polygonal plan from base to apex would con- 

form to the pure Dravida class of southern vimanas as described in 

the texts. Two more identical relief miniatures inside the two 

arched ends of the wagon-top sikhara of the Bhima Ratha repre- 

sent ekatala vimanas, each with a square body (aditala) over a. 

similar adhishthana carrying over the prastara a circular griva and 

circular sikhara with stupi, illustrating the Vesara class ofthe 

mixed variety since their griva and sikhara parts are circular, 

though the aditaki components below are square in section. What 

would appear io be tall and column-like dvitala, or two-storeyed 

forms of the pure Vesara vimanas, circular in section from base to 

apex, are represeated by the identical miniature reliefs found one 

at either end of the wagon-top sikhara of the Ganesa Ratha. 



The Trimurti cave-temple at Mahabalipuram differs from the - 

other rock-cut muandapa-type cave-temples of the Mahendra or 

Mamalla style, in that it represents only the vimana- or shrine- 

fronts of three contiguous units in bold relief without the frontal 

mandupa component. Each unit is complete with the adhishthana 

having a flight of steps in front, the aditala with an excavated

shrine-cellsand external pilasters, walls and niches, and the pras- 

tara with a prominent kapota adorned by kudu arches and the 

elements of the hara over it, at which stage the top'of the rock is 

reached. Further continuation upwards of ‘these three apparently 

dvitala vimana-fronts is barred by the limited height of the parent 

. rock. The three west-fating shrine-cells contain on their rear walls 

bas-reliefs of the principal deities. They are a standing Vishnu with 

devotees in the southern cell, a standing Siva with devotees in the 

middle ‘cell, and a standing Brahmanya or Brahmasasta, in place 

of Brahma with devotees inside.the northern cell. This is a slight 

variation from the presiding deities of the Mandagapattu cave- 

temple, which was the first such Pallava temple to be excavated by 

Mahendra I and which, according to his inscription, was dedicated 

to the Trinity—Vishnu, Siva and Brahma. These icons of Man- 

dagapattu. were perhaps painted on the walls of the three niche- 

like shrines of the cave-temple. The entrances of the three vimana- 

fronts are guarded by appropriate dvarapala figures carved inside 

the niches. On the rock face to the southi of the group is carved a 

relief ‘of Durga, standing on a severed buffalo-head, the head 

of the Mahishasura demon. It is inside a niche placed over 

the moulded adhishthana having a flight of'steps in front, as in 

the adjoining Trimurti shrine. The niche entrance is framed 

by two ‘pilasters carrying an elaborate forana, while over either 

extreme corner of the adhishthana platform are cut taller 

- pilasters, the whole scheme appearing to be a replica of the front 

elevation of the Draupadi Ratha but without the hut-like roof: 

carved on top. 

` The five rathas at the southern end of Mahabalipuram comprise 

a group by themselves. Of these the Draupadi, Arjuna, Bhima and 

Dharmaraja Rathas standing in a line are cuit out of a Single whale- 

‘back rock extending north-south and severed into three convenient 

sections. The northernmost section of lesser height has been utili- 

sedfor cutting out the shorter Draupadi Ratha and the Storeyed 

Arjuna Ratba, with a common platform, or upa-pitha, for both 

below their separate adhishthanas. The central longer segment with 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE ў ; 99 





a fairly horizontal top ridge has been appropriately utilised for the 

oblong Bhima Ratha, and the southern taller section, with a broa- 

der base too, for the three-storeyed Dharmaraja Ratha—all facing 

west. The fifth ratha—the Nakula-Sahadeva Ratha which is apsi- 

dal or of gaja-prishtha (elephant back) form and the adjoining 

sculpture of the elephant, both facing south, have been carved out 

of another smaller rock that stood independently in front on the 

west of the Draupadi and Arjuna Rathas. Another rock that stood 

close behind on the east of the Draupadi, and Arjuna Rathas was 

cut down to ground level in order to bring the rear aspects of 

these two: rathas into full view. The central mass that intervened 

between the two rathas was retained and cutout as a large sculp- 

ture of a recumbent Nandi facing west. A small upright free-stand- 

ing rock just in front of the Draupadi Ratha that would have 

hidden its front view has been shaped into a large sculpture of a 

standing lion facing north. 



Of the other four rathas, the Ganesa Ratha has been cut out of 

a boulder amidst the main hill in Mahabalipuram, and the two 

Pidari Rathas (northern and southern, so called because they are 

near the modern temple of the village goddess Pidari) and the 

Valaiyankuttai Ratha (standing in front of the Valaiyankuttai 

pond) are shaped out of free-standing boulders at. a distance on 

the western side of the main hill. 



The small Draupadi Ratha illustrates the type ofa very simple 

hut-like vimana, square on plan, with only four of the usual six 

angas of the vimana, namely, adhishthana, pada and bhitti, sikhara, 

and stupi, the angas that are lacking being the prastara and griya. 

"This chaturyarga rutha represents the kuta-type with a four-sided 

domical roof, or sikhara, crowned by a single stupi or finial. In 

having a square plan from base to apex, it exemplifies the pure 

Nagara „order. It is dedicated to Durga whose standing sculpture 

in relief, with attendants, is carved omthe rear wall of the sanc- 

tum. The main doorway is framed by. a fine torana as also the 

three devakoshthas which also enshrine standing relief sculptures 

of Durga on the three side walls. On either side of the doorway 





100 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





are flanking dvarapalikas, one on either side in the niche between 

the corner pilaster and the torana pilaster framing the entrance. 

This ratha lacks a mukha- or ardha-mandapa, unlike the other 

rathas, as also the nasikas projected from the sikhara. ў 



А dvitala and hence ashtanga, ог ashtavarga vimana of the same 

Nagara order, square from base to apex is illustrated in the incom- 

plete Valaiyankuttai Ratha facing east. Jt'has a small ardha- 

mandapa and the aditala has a single wall, hence it is nirandhara. 

The prastaras of both the talas carry arpita haras, appligue on the 

harmya of the second tala and on the griya above, and made up of 

four karnakutas at the corners and four salas in between them on 

each side over each face. There are nasikas on the four sides of the 

griva sikhara region. The hara at the aditala level is extended also 

over the top of the ardha-mandapa, a feature of all early vimanas. 

The kutas and salas over the mandapa are of-a smaller size than 

those over the aditala as usual. This is an example of the elabora- 

tion of the talachchhanda by the addition of one storey over the 

ekatala form of six angas illustrated by the bas-relief vimanas 

which are depicted in Arjuna's Penance sculpture and again at 

either end of the facade of the Ramanuja mandapam cave-temple. 

The northern ratha of the twin Pidari Rathas, facing north with 

its ardha-mandapa, is of the pure Nagara order, with only this 

difference that there is no hara over the second tala—an advanced 

feature—making it out as the last of the series in Mahabalipuram 

and anticipating in this respect the later vimanas of the eighth 

century. The griya sikhara faces are provided with projected 

nasikas. Both the rathas lack sculptures on their aditala walls and 

are incomplete. 



The incomplete southern Pidari Ratha facing east and the more 

complete Arjuna Ratha are likewise double-storeyed, square in 

section in both the alas and carrying applique haras of four karna- 

kutas and four salas at both levels. The griva and sikhara are, 

however, octagonal in section, making them both-ashtanga, niran- 

dhara vimanas of the Dravida order of the.composite variety, There 

are four nasikas projected from the four cardinal “sides "of the 





~ 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE . 101 





griya sikhara, The ardha-mandapa in both the vimanas carries haras 

_of kutas and salas of а smaller size than those over the aditala. 

There are no sculptures on the walls of the northern Pidari Ratha, 

while in the Arjuna Ratha the faces of the aditala from adhish- 

thana to prastara are offset thrice, at the.two corners and in the 

middle, and the reliefs contain plain niches carrying fine figure 

sculpture. The second tala too has sculpture on its walls inside the 

córner pilasters of each face that are exposed to view on either 

side of the central sala of the hara in front. The two pillars and 

two pilasters of the mandapa facade are vyala-based. As in all the 

above cases, the hara is extended over the mandapa. 

The Dharmaraja Ratha is three-storeyed, square in its talas and 

: octagonal in the griva sikhara region; but all the three storeys are 

intended to be functional. Thus the vimana is designed to have 

three superposed garbha-grihas, as against the . non-functional but 

„symbolic upper falas in the other rathas and most of the later 

structural examples. This is achieved by a cellular mode of con- 

struction with three concentric walled squares of increasing height 

rising one inside the other to the successive heights of the respec- 

tive falas, thus leaving interspaces in between. The outermost wall 

rising to the height of the aditala prastara is, however, present in 

:sections only round the four corners, the intervening open sides 

'having each a facade of two pillars and two pilasters, all vyala- 

based. The haras over the prastara of the three talas are thus 

detached from the fala Walls, and hence anarpita. The small 

mukha-mandapa on the west in front of the aditala carries a hara 

which in its composition includes for the first timé the apsidal nida 

or panjara. along with the kutas and salas. The octagonal griva 

sikhara region has four projected nasikas on the four cardinal 

sides. While the lower talas remain unfinished but for their ex- 

terior, the topmost fala has a sanctum excavated into it that 

enshrines a Somaskanda form of Siva, with Vishnu and Brahma 

in attendance carved on its rear wall. In addition to dyarapalas on 

either side of the entrance, this tala, like the two lower tala walls, 

contains in its niches fine sculptures of various gods illustrating 





102 : TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





varied features of early Pallava iconography. This was perhaps 

commenced by Mamalla, as indicated by the label inscribed on the 

eastern side of the second tala, and was brought to its present 

stage of completion with the consecration of the top tala by 

Paramesvaravarman, as the labels on the top tala would denote. 

In the Dharmaraja Ratha what apparently looks like the outer 

wall of the aditala cantoning the corners leaving open pillared 

entrances on the four cardinals, in between, is really the wall of 

an outer, narrow peripheral mandapa investing the aditalo or 

ground floor shrine. The pattern is really one where the wall of 

the aditala garbha-griha or cella rises up as the outer wall of the 

second’ tala sanctum which is rendered sandhara With an inner 

wall, in addition, that rises up higher as the wall of the third tala 

of lesser linear dimensions than the ones below. Thus the Dharma- 

raja Ratha is only pseudo-sandhara on its ground floor or aditala. 

The Bhima and Ganesa Rathas illustrate the oblong or ayatasra 

vimanas of the koshtha- or sala-type, with wagon-top roofs (sala. 

sikharas) carrying a row of stupis, or finials over the ridge as 

opposed to the kuta or convergent type of sikhara with a single 

finial in the others. The incomplete Bhima Ratha appears to be 

pseudo-sandhara, like the Dharmaraja Ratha, in that its oblong 

aditala is surrounded by a narrow mandapa with walls round the 

corners and intervening open facades of two pillars and two 

pilasters on the long and short sides, the pillars and pilasters being 

vyala-based. The mandapa carries above its prastara a hara of 

kutas at the four corners and sala in between, over the sides. The 

oblong sanctum facing west was perhaps intended for a reclining 

form of Vishnu with his head to the south and legs to the north. 

The oblong griya, which rises as an upper continuation of the 

garbha-griha walls, is rather tall. On each of the two long sides 

of the griva sikhara are five well projected nasikas in three sizes, 

the central one being the largest, the extreme ones middling, and 

the intermediate one being the smallest. The three larger ones 

represent full masikas with the prastara element in their com- 

position. The two smallest ones lack the prastara part. The 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 103 





harantara parts between the kutas and salas of the hara circuit 

have still smaller nasikas than are usual in all the other rathas. 

Thus this ratha alone would illustrate the various forms of nasikas 

as described in the texts. The two-storeyed Ganesa Ratha is 

nirandhara, single-walled, and with a narrow mukha-mandapa in 

front and of the same length as the aditala. The mandapa is walled © 

on its shorter sides and round the front corners leaving an open 

facade in front, with vyala-based pillars and pilasters. The hara 

over both the talas as also that over the mandapa contains the 

kutas and salas alone There are three projected nasikas on the 

two longer sides of the griva sikhara region, of which the central 

one is larger with the prastara element in its make-up and the two 

lateral ones smaller without that element. The stupis are integral 

and cut out at the completion of the vimana from the mass left 

over the ridge unlike in the other ,rathas where they are separate 

insertions. The crest of the two end-arches of the sikhara carry, in 

addition, a trisula finial each, which is the head of a three-horned 

sula deya represented-by the face only. Similar sula deya finials, like 

the sfupis. were inserted іп the case of the Bhima Ratha. Except 

the dvarapalas there ате no other sculptures in this ratha. In the 

facade of this ratha, besides the two vyala-based pillars, the 

pilasters of the facade are different, in that another type of 

mythical animal, a vyala-like form with beaked face, is introduced 

in the pilaster base. The ratha according to its inscription was 

originally dedicated to Siva; the Ganesa idol, now found planted 

in the cella, is an introduction of very recerit times. 



The dvitala-and wholly apsidal and nirandhara Nakula-Sahadeva 

Ratha well illustrates the dyayasra (two-sided with apse end) or 

chapa (bow-curve) form also called gaja- or hasti-prishtha, in that 

it resembles the rear of a standing elephant, a large sculpture of 

which is carved by the: side as if to emphasise the resemblance. 

The chapa form of the Nakula-Sahadeva Ratha: derives its archi- 

tectural nomenclature chapa from the fact that the shape of the 

vimana on plan resembles the “U'-shaped curve ofa fully drawn 

bow or chapa. Because of its elliptical shape, though truncated at 





104 ` TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





the front end, this is'also classified as of the Vesara order. It has 

a small open mukha-mandapa in front, of almost the same width 

as the aditala. The two front pillars are vyala-based and the two 

rear pilasters are clephant-based. The prastara over the aditala has 

а hara with two karnakutas at the two front corners, while over 

the sides and round the rear apse. there is a row of salas. The 

hara ori the mandapa too has only kutas and salas. The hara of 

the setond tala, however, shows two nidas or panjaras (which are 

ekatala miniatures.of the main vimana) between the two karnakutas 

on the front face, while the rest of the hara on the sides and round 

the curve is made up of salas. The innovation, namely, the addi- 

tion of the third element, the panjara or nida, in the composition 

of the hara seems to.have been made for the first time here, as 

over the mukha-mandapa of the Dharmaraja Ratha, the stage of 

completion of which should have been at about the same time as 

this apsidal ratha. This ratha has no sculpture either inside the 

sanctum, or on the-walls of the talas between the pilasters. 



The Pallava vogue of creating cut-out monolithic temple forms 

was soon caught up, as it were, not only by the neighbours of the 

Pallavas in south India, but also by others much beyond, and 

quite a few monolithic temples of the southern and northern types 

were created ín various parts of India, from the Tirunelveli district 

at the far southern tip of the peninsula to the Kangra district in 

the foot-hills of the Himalayas in the horth; from Bihar in the 

east to Mandsaur in the west -and Gwalior in central India—all 

within the two succeeding centuries.” : 

1Beyond the confines of the peninsula, the spread of this modeof carving down 

monolithig temples, though of the northern rekha-pranada type, is indicated in 

the west by the example of the Vaishnavite temple complex with seyen pari- 

vara shrines, entrenched iri the laterite hills of Dhamnar (Mandsaur district) 

of the eighth-ninth centuries. Inthe north there is the complex with parivara 

shrines of monolithic temples at Masrur (Kangra district) cut out of the over- . 

ground sandstone rock" and.attributable to the ninth century. In centrá 

India there is the Chaturbhujaji temple with prasada and mukha-mandapa on 



the sandstone Gwalior hill assignable to the Pratiharas of the ninth century, 

and also the incomplete monolithic temple of the tenth century carved out of 

a granite boulder near the summit.of a rocky island in the Ganga at Colgong 





(Bhagalpur district) on the east. It has a sala sikhara with 7 d gri 

with architectural wali-reliefs in the fashion of Orissan Через? ны Биа. 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 105 





Following this pioneering work of the Pallavas, a few attempts 

at the cutting-out of monolithic vimana forms in the sanie or 

succeeding centuries “are noticeable in the Eastern Chalukyan 

Tegion north -of the Pallava territory of Tondaimandalam. At 

Undavalli, immediately to the west of. the well-known four-storey- 

-ed cave-temple, the Anantasayanagudi, a projecting section of the 

rock is cut into a-temple form with vimana and front mandapas, 

the latter fully cut-out and the former presented externally in front 

‘elevation. The tiered superstructure rises on the main hill face 

‘over the top line of the front mandapas. Internally, the work 

presents thefull aspect of an excavated. cave-temple with front 

halls and a.shrine-cell behind. The mandapa facade has two pillars 

and two pilasters, all of thé plain type. There is a well-defined 

kapota on its architrave decorated by kudu arches. The lateral wall 

of the mukha-mandapa inside has devakoshthas, now empty. Similar 



| niches surmounted by foranas are to be found on the rear wall of 



' the ardha-mandapa on either side of the shrine-entrance. Thé 

shrine-cell is empty. In the adjoining rock faces bas-relief vimana 

miniatures are cut, six in number, of varying sizes and much 

resembling the model bas-reliefs seen in Arjuna's Penance com- 

position and on either side of the Ramanuja mandapam at Maha- 

balipuram. They are replicas of ekatala Nagara vimanas, square 

in section from base to apex. 



The much damaged remains of a monolithic vimana are to be 

found in Vijayawada, in front of the upper cave-temple of the, 

Akkanna-Madanna group. In the precincts of the apsidal brick 

temple of Kapotesvara at Chejerla: (Guntur district). are to be 

found a number of” miniature shrine models, monolithic in 

character, evidently of a votive nature. These would also recall 

similar models found in the temple precincts at Satyavolu, Maha- 

nandi and Alampur in the adjoining Kurnool district. One of the 

Chejerla models is interesting, in that it shows.a completely free- 

standing pair of pillars for the shrine-front. — . 



While the contemporary Western Chalukyas of Badami, who 

were forging ahead with their structural stone temples, did not 





106 : TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





take.up the carved-out monolithic mode of the Pallavas, the 

Rashtrakutas, who soon replaced the Chalukyas in their own 

territory, took it up. with zest and, among others, created at Ellora 

the greatest and largest monolithic version. of a southern temple 

complex that is familiarly known as the Kailasa. 



This creation of Rashtrakuta Krishna I. (756-775) is .rather 

unique. By trenching vertically down into the sloping hill on all 

sides of a chosen area at right angles up to the base of the rock, 

an oblong central mass (about 60m х З0т) was isolated and in 

front of it, beyond the wider front trench, a further trench isolated 

а narrower transversely oblong mass stretching across like a wall. 

The larger oblong mass, longer from front to rear than from 

Side to side, afforded the material for carving out the complex of 

the main vimana and its axial mandapas, as also.two tall and stout . 

free-standing monolithic'pillars on either side in front surrounded 

by an open courtyard formed by trenches on all the sides. The 

fore-court on the front, measuring 90m х 60m, was:cut wider than 

on the sides .and 'it is on the two sides of this that the two mono- 

lithic free-standing pillars are found carved. The much narrower, 

transversely oblong mass in front afforded the material for the 

carving out of а front gopura entrance, with the two wings of 

prakara walls on either side. The gopura is double-storeyed with a 

sala sikhara on top and a passage cut through its lower part to 

provide agcess to the fore-court in front and the circumambulatory 



„Passage round the base of the main vimana complex. The upper 

storey is connected with the floor of the Nandi-mandapa. This is 

likewise conceived as a two-storeyed structure with the lower 

storey solid and non-functional and serving only as a raised 

platform, despite the external markings of all the architectural 

features ef an aditala, and the upper functional, containing Nandi 

inside. The main part of the temple beyond consists essentially of 

a yimana containing the sanctum with an antarala, or ardha- 

mandapa, and a clpsed maha-manadapa axially in front. The whole: 

axial series is raised over a highly ornate plinth with its tep plat- 

form supported, as it were, over a frieze of boldly carved fronts. 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 107 





of elephants, lions and'a number of mythological animals. The 

maha-mandapa is cantoned at its two rear corners by dvitala 

vimanas of the kuta-type, and has three projected porcli-openings 

on the middle of its south, west and north sides, which are super- 

posed by larger and more raised salas to simulate gopuraii-like 

entrances. The top of the mandapa is morc or less flat with 2 large 

multi-petalled lotus surrounding the base of the finial cut over its 

centre. Behind the maha-mandapa and the antarala stands the 

principal vimana, its moulded square adhishthana of lesser sides 

than those of the platform below, occupying the centre df the 

upa-pitha, while five detached sub-shrines are cut at intervals over 

the edge of the platform. The three lesser vimanas on the three 

cardinal sides of the upa-pitha are dvitala sala yimanas, while the 

two at the rear corners are tritala kuta vimanas. These five to- 

gether with the two dummy dvitala kuta vimanas embracing the 

hind corners of the maha-mandapa, and the Nandi shrine in front, 

would complete the full complement of the ashta parivara or 

shrines of the eight subsidiary deities round the principal vimana, 

a concept already evolved in the structural temples of the far 

south. The principal vimana is four-storeyed (chatushtala). The 

lowermost tala of the superstructure over the aditala with sanctum 

is projected in front over the antarala to form a gable-like projec- 

tion called sukanasika, a characteristic of the southern temples of . 

the Chalukyan series as well as of all their northern prasada 

temples. Though the talas are square, the griva and sikkara are 

octagonal, making the vimana conform to the Dravida class of the 

mixed type. The stupi, now missing, was not part of the monolith. 

On the four corners of the topmost fala, which is devoid of a 

hara, are placed four bulls, the cognizant Janchanas. The structure 

is replete with sculpture of varied iconography. Behind this on the 

hill are the remains of an unfinished sala-type edifice, піоло- 

lithic likewise and akin to the Bhima and Ganesa Rathas of the 

Pallavas. 



The monolithic Nandi-mandapa in front of Cave 15 at Ellora 

with an inscription of Rashtrakuta Dantidurga is perhaps, a 





108 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





slightly earlier carved-out monolith in this region. 



The smaller and müch later Jain monolithic version of the 

Kailasa Vimana, also of the Rashtrakuta period at Ellora, is popu- 

larly called the Chota Kailasa. There is another chaumukh standing 

in the fore-court of Cave 33. It isa tritala vimana with square 

talas and with the aditala having projected, porch-like entrances on 

the four cardinal sides. The stela is placed at the centre of the 

-sanctum floor and is visible through the doors from all four sides. 

"The top of the porch projections carry panjara-like nasika fronts 

instead of the usual salas of the hara. There are the usual karna- 

kutas at the corners. The second tala.has four cardinally projected 

nasikas and no karnakutas. The top tala has no hara, but has four 

lions; the cognizant Janchanas at the cofners. The griya and sikhara 

are octagonal, making the vimana Dravida of the mixed variety. 

The monolithic temple complex, called the “Chota Kailasa’ is not 

the monolithic Chaumukh Vimana, in the Indra Sabha fore-court. 

The Chota Kailasa stands farther away and higher up. It is a Jain 

replica’ of the Kailasa (Siva temple complex), with a dvitala 

vimana having an octagonal sikhara, the sukanasa, leaving to -an 

upper shrine in the second zala over the aditala. The tala prastara 

is provided with a hara of kutas and salas and the axial extensions 

in front of the vimana constitute mukha- and maha-mandapas with 

a triple entrance; and a dvara-mandapa with sculptures at the 

entrances leading into the entrenched court, 



As against these Pallava and Rashtrakuta creations, the contri- 

‘bution by the contemporary Pandyas of the far south to this series 

is ‘the exquisitely carved Vettuvankovil monolith at Kalugumalai 

(Tirunelveli district). It can be dated about A.D. 890, if not slightly 



earlier. Unlike the Pallava technique of free-cutting or carving 

down of segmented parts of standing rocks or free-standing boul- 

ders of hard rocks, the Pandyas, though they always followed the 

Pallava tradition of rock architecture in hard stones, adopted in 

the creation of this monolith the trenching technique of the 

Rashtrakutas as at Ellora. Both the dyitala vimana and its ardha- 

mandapa cut out of the entrenched mass on the hill slope are 





ARCHITECTURAL SCULPTURE 109 





incomplete, but the finished upper parts reveal a high degree of, 

workmanship and art and contain some outstanding sculptures. ' 





The talas are square on plan and the griya and sikhara are octago- 

nal. Thus this would be an example in the Dravida order of the 

misra type. The four Nandis on the corners of the top fala round 

the base of the griva indicate the date and the dedication of the 

temple to Siva. The dating js further indicated by the sculptures 

of Dakshinamurti, Vishnu, Brahma and Siva on the south, west, 

north and east nasika-fronts, respectively, on the faces of the griva 

sikhara, a feature that became constant from the ninth century 

- onwards. : 





` CHAPTER VI 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES— 

THE EARLY PHASE . 





THE PALLAVA-PANDYA SERIES 





WHILE WITH the Chalukyas of Badami, the construction of stone 

temples started, almost simultaneously, if not as a sequel to their 

cut-in-cave-temples, with the Pallavas of Kanchi, it may be said 

that the structural vogue started after their cut-out monoliths from 

the time of Narasimhavarman II Rajasimha (700-728). In the keen 

competition with their Chalukyan rivals, that had all along moti- 

vated the urge for unique achievements in architecture and faced 





with the comparatively greater difficulty in the quarrying and 





sizing of such very hard native rocks as granite, gneiss and char- 

nockite—as against the soft standstone exploited with ease and 

advantage by the Chalukyas—Rajasimha Pallava experimented, as 

it were, with the different kinds of stones from the rocks of Ton- 

daimandalam. Furthermore, *rock architecture' implied the creation 

of temples only in places where there were hills or rocks. Such 

temples could not be created elsewhere, for instance, in the Pallava 

capital of Kanchi. His experiments with different kinds of stones 

. could be seen from the blackish hard variety of leptinite used in 

the Shore temple, the hard reddish gneiss in the Mukundanayanar 

temple, and the somewhat softer greyish-white' granite employed 

in the Olakkannesvara temple, all in Mahabalipuram, and the 

hard pinkish .gneiss of the Talagirisvara temple at Panamalai. 

Finding that construction in these hard stones was difficult and 

time-consuming, and in order to step up the tempo and keep pace 

with, if not outstrip, his rivals, Rajasimha ultimately resorted to 

the soft stone tradition and had to employ ‘the coarse, friable, 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 111 





local standstones of a not Very commendable quality for the tem- 

ples in his capital city. Even in such standstone constructions the 

use of hard stone, a tradition inaugurated by his forbears, was not 

totally abandoned. It was used as slabs and as the bottom and top 

courses of the basement or adhishthana, namely, the upana and 





pattika components. The great Kailasanatha temple in Kanchi 

and others in the same place are of this kind. However much the 

Pallavas lagged behind the Chalukyas in this respect, their mono- 

lithic or cut-out ratha interlude did confer definite advantages, for 

it gave them better ideas of form, proportion and design that 

helped -them in making their structural edifices more elegant and 

better composed and dimensioned than. the Chalukyan structural 

creations. 



The Shore temple ‘at Mahabalipuram is a complex of three 

Shrines with accessory mandapas, prakara enclosures and gopura 

entrances. Of the three, the larger vimana facing the sea on the 

east, called Kshatriyasimhesvara,. and the smaller vimana at its 

rear facing the village on the west called Rajasimhesvara, are both 

dedicated to Siva and have wedged in between them a rectangular 

mandapa-shrine without a superstructure—called Narapatisimha- 

Pallava-Vishnugriha. This is built over a previously existing re- 

cumbent Vishnu carved on.a low rocky outcrop. These names 

inscribed on the structure are all titles of Rajasimha, the builder of 

the complex. The axial mandapas and gopuras are built in front of 

the smaller vimana, and the whole is enclosed by a common prakara 

wall. The Jarger eastern vimana has ап additional prakara of its 

own, closely investing it on the east, south and north, and leaving 

the west open. The smaller vimana is three-storeyed, all square on 

plan, but with octagonal griya and sikhara and stupi on top. While 

the uditala is devoid of the hara elements on top,it has, like the 

top tala, four seated bhutas placed at the corners blowing conches. 

The hara elements are found over the second tala on all the four 

sides, and again over the ardha-mandapa in front of the aditala, 

The bhuta forms take the place of Nandis or bulls to be invariably 

found оп the top fala of the later Siva temples. The falas are 





112 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





proportionately tall, the top tala rising high and clear over the hara: 

elements of the tala below, the stupi over the octagonal griva and 

.sikhara being made of polished black basalt. The pilasters on the 

walls have rearing lion bases, as is characteristic of the Rajasimha 

temples. The four storeyed eastern vimana is also of square plan 

up to the griva which with the sikhara and basalt stupi above is 

octagonal. The hara of kutas and salas are rcstricted to the tops 

of the second and third talas, as also to the top of the ardha-man- 

dapa in frónt of the aditala, which carries instead figures of squat- 

ting lions at the four corners. The top tala has four squatting 

bhutas blowing conches, symbolizing a Siva temple, as in the case 

of the smaller vimana. The very closely set prakara that is special 

to this vimana is of a lesser height than the aditala, and carries 

karnakutas at the corners and salas over. the:lengths of the sides. 

The gap at the rear on the west is partially filled by the hara 

‘elements on top of the Vishnu mandapa at the same level. The 

central sala over the seaward entránce on the eastern length of this 

prakara is made larger than the rest in order to simulate a dyarasala 

or lesser gopura scheme. The proportionately tall storeys and the 

elimination of the hara elements over the lowest and topmost falas 

lend a grace and charm to this attenuated structure, while the 

close-set prakara of a lesser height surrounding the aditala, with 

hara elements over its coping, gives externally the appearance of 

an additional tala. It apparently enlarges its basal area in apt pro- 

portion to the total height. The usual’ Somaskanda relief panels 

are found on the rear walls of both the vimana sanctums in addi- 

tion to a sixteen-sided, fluted, polished, basalt linga, planted with- 

out the usual pedestal on the centre of the floor of the garbha-griha. 

Though the sculptures on the walls of this temple complex are 

much eroded by the moist and saline winds from the sea, the archi- 

tectural proportions and make-up, and the natüral setting on the 

sea make the edifice one of the finest monuments in India. Besides 

fhe usual rearing lion-based pilasters, the larger vimana shows 

on its own walls and those of its prakara, other types which have- 

the elephant, ram, naga, nagadeva, and bhuta forms for their bases.. 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 113: 

à z i 

Fhe Olakkannesvara structure on top -of the light-house hill, j 

devoid of its original superstructural falas and with the outer shell 

of its aditala and-ardha-mandapa alone extant (owing to its earlier 

conversion and use as a light-house before the present one was 

constructed in 1900) retains the sculptures, niches and pilasters of 

the outer walls. Its most interesting feature is thd occurrence of the 

Dakshinamurti icon in the central niche on the southern side, 

heralding this usual feature of the southern vimanas which follow- 

ed. Án important feature that enables one to assign the Olakkan- 

nesvara temple to Rajasimha Pallava is the presence of rearing 

vyala-based pilasters cantoning the outer corners of the.shrine and 

ardha-mandapa. 



The Talagirisvara temple on the Panamalai Rock (south Arcot 

district) of the same pinkish-red hard granite has an interesting 

plan. It is essentially square on its base and talas, but its east- 

facing aditala has smaller oblong shrines with cells attached to the 

middle of its south, west and northern sides Óver corresponding 

Offset extensions of the adhishthana. The corresponding oblong 

attachment on the east, with the passage through it, forms the 

antarala entrance to the, main sanctum. The two: lateral shrines 

facing east as also the rear shrine facing west are, like the main 

sanctum, dedicated to Siva. The main sanctum has a Somaskanda 

relief panel inside a special niche high upon its rear wall and vis- 

ible above the top of the fluted Zinga stele, planted without a pitha 

on the sanctum floor, unlike the other Rajasimha temples where the 

linga more or less hides the Sómaskanda panel, set at the centre 

of the rear wall. The vimana is four-storeyed, and the sala super- 

structures of the two-storeyed oblong side shrines are dexterously 

made to merge into the hara of karnakuta and other elements: of 

the aditala, The hara is found again on the upper storeys except 

the topmost. The griva and sikhara which are modern restorations 

in brick-and-mortar are, as per the original plan, octagonal. The- 

corners of the walls of the aditala and of the attached shrines are 

cantoned by bold rearing vyala pilasters characteristic of Rajasimha 

temples. The top tala carries bhuta forms at the corners. Otherwise 





114 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





the walls lack sculpture as in the Mukundanayanar temple, 

evidently because of the hard material of construction. There are 

only the dvarapalas and the Brahma and Vishnu sculptures on the 

inner walls of the antarala that maintain the original Trimurti con- 

cept, but with Brahma and Vishnu relegated to lesser positions. 

The northern outer shrine contains remnants of a Pallava mural 

painting depicting a dancing Siva with Parvati. 



The Mukundanayanar temple in Mahabalipuram, also.built of 

а reddish granite, isa more plain and severe structure, with a 

dvitala vimana, square below but with octagonal griva sikhara, and 

is hence Dravida. It consists of the vimana and mandapa in front. 

The upper parts of the sikhara and the stupi are lost. The walls are 

plain, the pilasters simple, crudely shaped and devoid of vyala 

bases. It contains a Somaskanda relief as the main deity on the 

back wall of the sanctum. 



The Kailasanatha complex at Kanchi is a joint venture of Raja- 

simha and his son Mahendra III. The main vimana, Rajasimhesvara 

(now called Kailasanatha) facing east is four-storeyed, and is 

essentially a square structure up to the griva, which and the sikhara, 

above are octagonal. The aditala is double-walled and its moulded 

base is prominently offset on all the four sides and four corners— 

for they carry over them smaller shrines with cella in them, abutting 

on and incorporated with the outer wall of the main aditala, This 

is an elaboration of the feature found in the Panamalai temple. 

While the adhishthana offsets. at the four corners are square and 

carry smaller two-storeyed vimanas of square plan with four-sided 

kuta sikharas, those on the four sides are oblong and carry smaller 

dvitala vimanas of the oblong plan, with sala sikharas on the south, 

west and north. The corresponding one on the east is also oblong 

with the: sala superstructure having a passage through in place of 

a cella and functioning as the antarala passage to the main sanctum. 

The kuta and sala sikharas of the abutting shrines are cleverly in- 

corporated into the hara scheme over the prastara of the outer wall 

of the aditala as in Panamalai. The cells of these abutting vimanas 

in their ground storeys enshrine forms of Siva. The abutting

.Yimangs оп: the south-east, south, north and north-east face east 

like the main sanctum, while those. on the: South-west, west and 

north-west face west..Tle main‘sanctum bas а large fluted, sixteen- 

faceted, polished, basalt linga with an.immense circular linga- -pitha 

occupying almost the entire floor of the sanctum. On the rear wall, 

in a special-niche, is carved the usual Somaskanda panel, with Siva 

and Uma seated with little Skanda on Uma's lap and Brahma and 

Vishnu standing behind on either side, The inner wall of the garbha- 

griha is plain and square, while the outer wall, visible in parts 

between the abutting vimanas, is profusely sculptured -with reliefs 

of gods and goddesses, as also are the walls of the abutting: struc-, 

tures. In between the two walls internally is a narrow, covered, 

circumambulatory passage. The superstructural falas are built 

over a-bridge of slabs spanning the tops of the two massive walls 

of the aditala. The double-walling and the additional buttressing 

by smaller vimanas on the sides and corners are evidently expedients 

to support the mass of the superstructure of this vimana, which is 

the largest one of the period, and at the same time to provide a 

pleasing base to the height ratio and a balanced proportion to the 

edifice. While the panjaras are absent among the hara elements over 

the aditala prastara, which, in addition to the corner kuta and the 

lateral sala sikharas of the abutting shrines, carries salas over the 

intervening parts of the aditala outer wall, the hara of the second 

tala has the full complement of kutas, salas, and panjaras. The third 

Storey has again a hara of kutas and salas above, and the fourth 

carries only four Nandis on the four corners at its top. The pilasters 

contoning the aditala wall and those of the abutting shrines have 

rearing vyala bases, peculiar to the Rajasimha temples. There is a 

‘detached ‘multi-pillared oblong mandapa in front, longer on its 

north-south axis and with its cantoning pilasters yyala-based» while 

the rest are of the plainer type with basal and apical square 

sections and intervening octagonal belts. The whole is surrounded 

by.a prakara with a gap on the middle of its east side and enclosing. 

an open court all around. The large eastern opening is occupied 

by a fair-sized oblong dvitala sala-type vimana, with its ardha- 





116 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





mandapa, the vimana itself appearinglike a gopura when viewed 

from a distance. Both its talas are devoid of the hara. This vimana, 

called Mahendravarmesvara after Rajasimha's-son, contains in its 

sanctum the usual fluted linga and Somaskanda panels, besides 

Brahma and Vishnu sculptures on the inner wall of the ardha- 

mandapa, as also other sculptures on its outer wall and in the 

devakoshthas. The cantoning pilasters are rearing vyala-based. The 

prakara has another entrance on the west at the middle, which is a 

real gopura-entrance with a sala superstructure; it is smaller in 

magnitude. All round the inner face of the prakara is built an 

array of fifty-eight small dvitala vimanas all except -wO being square 

and of the kuta type. They are all dedicated to Siva except the two 

which are oblong and come opposite the north and south of the 





“main Rajasimhesvara sanctum and contain groups of Vishnu and 





Brahma sculptures facing south and north, respectively. But among 

the kuta vimanas of the malika of parivara shrines, those along the 

east face west, those along the west face east, while those on the 

north and south both face east. The cells of many of these contain 

traces of old paintings on plain walls or painted stucco over reliefs. 

The external walls of these parivara shrines of the malika contain a 

variety of sculptures, both Saivite and Vaishnavite, of varied icono- 

graphy, thus making this temple complex a veritable museum of 

iconography and plastic art. The sculptures include the dikpalas 

and Ganesa, who makes his first appearance in Pallava temples, as 

also the Saptarnatrika group, Chandesa and other parivara deities. 

The Mahendravarmesvara has a smaller enclosure with a small 

gopura or dyarasala infront and two lateral entrances in addition 

near the two front corners. Inside there are two lateral oblong 

shrines in the centre on the north and south. In front of the whole 

complex stands a row of eight small dvitala square kuta vimanas 

with octagonal griva and sikhara, all of them memorial shrines, 

and, like the Mahendravarmesvara and the parivara shrines of the: 

inner malika, devoid of the hara elements over their talas. All of 

them contain Somaskanda panels on their hind walls and varied 

sculpture on their external walls. 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 117 





The remnants of fresco paintings found inside the various cloister 

shrines around the Rajasimhesvara of the Kailasanatha complex 

in Kanchipuram cannot, all of them, be coeval with the date of 

the main shrine and Pallava. While some are undoubtedly Pallava, 

painted over the plaster ground laid over the coarse sandstone 

surface, which expedient was found necessary (as at Ajanta) to 

smoothen and protect the stone surface even at the outset, there 

are undeniable evidences of the renewal of the plaster.and the 

‘paintings over them in subsequent periods. For example, in one of, 





the cells on the north-east corner of the malika. the extant plaster 

was found by the present writer to overlie an inscription on the: 





stone below, of Rajasimha himself. This alone would denote that 

the plastering was at best an afterthought in the times of the 

founder himself or immediately thereafter. For, an inscription 

would not be incised on a surface if it was to be covered over by 

plaster. Likewise the present writer again found in another cell, on 

the southern row, the painted plaster revealing beyond its broken 

edges, parts of a later Chola inscription of Kulottunga I (Accn. 

A.D. 1070) indicating that the stone face was bare at that time and 

that the plaster was laid after that time. Thus the painting over it 

could only be after the above date. From other evidences it is 

known that the temple, which was flourishing in Pallava and early 

Chola times, fell into disuse in the times of the later Cholas, (after 

Kulottunga I) till the times of the rise of the Vijayanagar dynasty. 

Prince Kampana is known from inscriptions to have repaired the 

damages wrought by the Muslim incursions and restored worship 

in the temple. This accounts for fragmentary paintings of the 

Vijayanagar period too. Thetemple saw bad times again sub- 

sequently till it became a protected monument and came to be 

attended to. Thus the Panamalai temple painted fragment, men- 

tioned earlier, would alone be the earliest Pallava painting extant 

as found so far. 



The Vaikunthaperumal temple in Kanchi built by Nandivarman 

Pallavamalla (A.D. 731-796) and dedicated to Vishnu is another 

Pallava structure of the larger variety facing west and built in 





118 ‘TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





sandstone with.an admiixture.of granite, jn :the-top and bottom 

courses of its .adhishthana. It has a. square four-storeyed main 

vimana with allthe. talas except the:topmost, containing the super- 

posed garbha-grihas, to enshrine the-three forms of Vishnu, stand- 

ing (sthanaka), sitting (asana), and reclining (sayana). It is thus a 

fore-runner of many such Vishnu temples that came later even till 

recent times, e.g. 'the .Sundaravaradaperumal ‘temple at Uttira- 

merur, the Chitrakuta at Madurai, and the Vishnu temple at 

Mannarkovil, to mention only a few. The triple storey has been 

achieved by a system of three concentric walls forming three con- 

centric squares, one inside the other with ambulatory passages in 

between in the sandhara mode. They are set on top of a boldly 

moulded adhishthana, the innermost wall rising to the height of the 

three storeys, enclosing the three tiers of cells, the intermediate wall 

rising to the terrace level of the second storey, and. the outermost 

stopping short of the terrace level of the first storey. The aditala has 

thus its sanctum: surrounded by two covered circumambulatory 

passages, the outer one functioning as such while the inner one | 

provides access to the second tala. There is a flight of steps on the 

north and south, for ascent and descent providing access to and 

exit from the second fala, terminating in an opening on the centre 

of the west outer wall. The open outer ambulatory of the -second 

tala is surrounded by the parapet on top of the outermost wall 

formed by a hara of kutas, salas and panjaras; the inner covered 

ambulatory lies at the heads of the two flight of steps from below. 

This hara is extended over the top of the pillared ardha-mandapa in 

front of the aditala. The intermediate wall extending up to the top 

of the second fala and enclosing the closed ambulatory carries on 

top a similar hara forming the parapet edging for the open circum- 

ambulatory passage round the third-tier cella. The innermost wall 

reaching to ‘the top of the third-tier cella has, likewise, a hara of 

kutas and salas, The kutas, salas and panjaras of each tier crown 

the correspondingly relieved bays and recesses of the walls. The 

fourth tala, which is a smaller square, is closed on.all sides and 

carries the octagonal griya and sikhara with a metal stupi on top, 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 119 





and four lions originally (now replaced by Garuda figures in 

stucco) at its four corners. The central bays of the aditala outer 

wall have small door-openings, while the lateral ones have deva- 

koshthas with figure sculpture, the intermediate recesses having 

perforated windows. The bays and recesses of the upper tala outer 

walls have similar sculpture, all Vaishnavite. The lowermost storey 

and the ardha-mandapa i in front are surrounded by an open narrow 

circuit at the level of the base of the adhishthana. The whole is 

again surrounded by a pillared cloister running all round on a 

raised platform with vyala-based pillars on the edge facing the 

central edifice and a wall on the outer edge that carries on its top 

a string of kutas and salas,-at a level slightly lower than that of 

the aditala. This arrangement when viewed from outside would 

simulate a pancha tala appearance, as in the case of the Shore 

temple described earlier. In addition to the numerous divine 

sculptures on the vimana and ardha-mandapa acd contemporary 

inscriptions, the most interesting part of this temple would 

bea series of .panelled sculptures narrating the history of the 

Pallavas from their legendary ancestors down to the time of 

Nandivarman II Pallavamalla, the builder of the temple, a unique 

feature rarely met with elsewhere. 



The other temples of this period to be found in Kanchi, though. 

smaller in proportions, are interesting for their architecture and: 

iconography. They are the Muktesvara, Matangesvara, Airavat- 

esvara, Valisvara, Iravatanesvara and Piravatanesvara temples, 

built mainly of sandstone with granite slabs forming the base and 

top of the adhishthana, and the upa-pitha platform below it in cases 

where it is added to raise the stature of the edifice. All of them are 

composite varieties of the square vimana with varying numbers of 

talas, the upper storeys non-functional and closely invested by the 

hara over the prastara of the storey below, and with different plans 

in the griva sikhara part. The Iravatanesvara and Tripurantakes- 

vara are dyitala, square throughout, including the griya and 

sikhara, and hence are Nagara. The Matangesvara and Muktesvara 

temples which are #ritala have likewise square falas, but carry 





120 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Circular griva. and sikhara conforming to the Vesara. The Piravat- 

anestara and Valisvara are two- and three-storeyed, respectively, 

their talas square, but the griva and sikhara octagonal, making 

them Dravida. The superstructure of the Airavatesvara is lost. The 

Kailasanatha at Tiruppattur (Tiruchirapalli district) is a larger 

vimana in sandstone and. is much like the Kailasanatha of Kanchi. 

It is of the late eighth century and is an example of the provincial 

variety of the Pallava vimana. 





But soon after the middle of the long reign of Nandivarman II ` 





Pallava, in the later part of the eighth century, temples came to be 

built entirely of granite blocks, cut, moulded, carved and sculp- 

tured, as seen in some cf the smaller temples and in the granite 

adhishthanas of the large brick temples of Vaikunthaperumal and 

Sundaravaradaperumal at Uttiramerur (Chingleput district) of the 

time of his successor, Dantivarman. In the former,:the niches were 

meant to contain stucco figures and in the latter slab reliefs. The 

extant three-storeyed brick structure of Sundaravaradaperumal over 

its stone adhishtiiana is unique again in having all the three storeys 

functional with the cellas dedicated to the standing, seated and 

reclining forms of Vishnu, while the abutting smaller shrines on the 

three sides of its two lower falas south, west and north, contain the 

six other principal forms of Vishnu—Satya, Achyuta, Aniruddha, 

Naranarayana, Narasimha, and Varaha—thus incorporating the 

nine forms or navamurtis in accordance with the Vaikhanasa Agama. 

These two temples and the large and fine renovated brick temple at 

Tiruvadigai (south Arcot district) on a stone adhishthana corrobo- 

rate the fact that brick-and-timber continued to remain in use in 

spite of the advent of stone, and skills in their use in large con- 

structions were fostered and maintained. 



The Virattanesvara temple at Tiruttani (Chingleput district) 

affords a very good example of a single-storeyed vimana square in 

its adhishthana and aditala that carries an apsidal griva sikhara 

superstructure. It was built of hard black stone in the ninth 

century in the time of Pallava Aparajitavarman, one of the last 

rulers of the dynasty. It contains some good bas-reliefs in its wall

STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASB 121 





niches which exemplify the definite polarisation of the deities in 

the vimana and ardha-mandapa devakoshthas, namely, Ganesa and 

Durga, respectively, in the soüthern and northern outer wall 

niches of the ardha-mandapa and Dakshinamurti, Vishnu and 

Brahma, respectively, in the south, west and north outer wall 

niches of the aditala wall. The introduction of a projected gar- 

goyle-like water-outlet, the pranala, from the northern side of the 

garbha-griha floor to drain off the abhisheka water, till now not 

noticed in earlier temples, is another noteworthy feature. The 

pranala becomes an invariable component of all the temples built 

later. 



The credit of constructing fine vimanas of hard stone, though 

small, and perfecting the same would, however, go to the con- 

temporary Pandyas of the south who, following their rock-cut 

temples and the single carved-out monolithic vimana—the Vet- 

tuvankovil at Kalugumalai (A.D. 800), built a series of small 

karralis, or all-stone temples, in the southern districts. The con- 

temporary Western Gangas of the Talkad in the south Mysore 

area, and the Muttaraiyar, the Irukkuvel and other chiefs on 

either bank of the Kaveri, is the dividing border line between the 

Pallava and Pandya Empires, followed by the early Cholas (who 

till then in hibernation had risen at the close of.the ninth century 

to imperial power with their capital at Thanjavur, and soon spread 

over the Pallava and Pandya territories) have likewise left a 

number of fine temples in granite dating before A.D. 1000. 



The series of small and elegant all-stcne temples at Kaliyapatti, 

Tiruppur, Visalur and Panangudi (Pudukkottai district) have 

square ekatala vimanas with simple moulded adhishthanas, less than 

2m square at the base, carrying on top over the cella a square 

griya and sikhara. In addition to the vimana koshtha devatas in 

the prescribed order as mentioned above, in the context of the 

Tiruttani Virattanesvara, they have eight smaller sub-shrines, the 

ashta parivara, dedicated to the ancillary deities located on the 

corners and sides and inside the prakara wall that surrounds the 

nuclear vimana and its axial adjuncts. While all the rest of the 





122 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





eight sub-shrines are square on plan like the main vimana, the 

one on the middle of the south side, dedicated to the Saptama- 

trikas, is rendered oblong with an appropriate sala sikhara as. 

exemplified in the typical temple complex of the Sundaresvara at 

Tirukkattalai (Pudukkottai district). Such oblong or elliptical 

shrines of the linear pattern are prescribed for and found employ- 

ed in cases where the deity is reclining, or where more than one 

deity (as the Saptamatrikas) is installed in a row, or a deity is 

with consorts (like Sri and Bhu Devis for Vishnu), and attendants 

are enshrined in the sanctum. The oblong form with sala sikhara 

became the invariable rule, according to prescription and practice, 

for all the Devi shrines. Occasionally also, one or more of the 

other seven parivara shrines deviate in form, as, for example, the 

apsidal or gaja-prishtha (elephant back) sub-shrine for Gajanana. 

or Ganesa found in the Sundaresvara 'temple at Nangavaram 

(Tiruchirapalli district). The cult of Chandesa as the mulabhritya, 

or chief seneschal of a Siva temple, which had its emergence even 

in the time of Rajasimha Pallava as seen in his Kailasanatha at 

Kanchi, had now become crystallised and one of the ashta parivara 

sub-shrines on the north was assigned to him till about A.D. 1000. 

Subsequently in the temples of the imperial Chola period he, like 

-Nandi of earlier times and the other equal associate of Siva, 

Chandesa, came to have a more honoured place by coming into 

closer proximity with the main vimana just to the north of the 

pranala which had by now emerged on the northern side of the 

main vimana. These form the peculiar features of the southern 

temples, particularly of the temples of Tamil Nadu. 



The Balasubrahmanya temple at Kannanur and the Siva 

temple at Viralur (both in Pudukkottai district) are examples of 

the kind where the griva and sikhara are circular in section, mount- 

ed over the square body of the ekatala vimana. The former carries 

on the four corners of its aditala four elephant figures as- symbols

district) and the similar Siva temple in Tiruvalisvaram. (Tirunelveli 

district) are slightly larger examples. The former has four karna- 

kuta miniature shrines at the corners of the topmost tala in place · 

of the Nandis. The latter is noted for its fine sculptures and 

cameos in relief on its walls and superstructure, amongst which is 

to be found the well-known ananda-tandaya of Siva Nataraja, 

perhaps the earliest depiction of this characteristically crystallised 

and sublimated concept of Tamil Nadu and its unique contribution 

to Indian and world art. 



The celebrated icon of Nataraja in the characteristic ananda- 

tandava pose, depicting, esoterically, the pancha kritya of Siva of 

Tamilian Saiva Siddhanta, as ably described and interpreted by 

Coomaraswamy, makes its advent late in the ninth century. The 

Saiva saint, Manikkavachakar is the first among the Nayanmars 

to refer to this form and aspect of Siva’s dance and the small 

Tiruvalisvaram panel (c. A.D. 890) is perhaps the first to capture 

the imagery in stone. The concept was perhaps first revealed in | 

copper or bronze, in the casting of which the Tamilian artisan had 

achieved skill and excellence, primarily to serve as a processional 

deity, that came to be translated into stone subsequently. Such 

early stone representations are to be met with again, in miniature 

mostly, as the crest figure in a niche torana arch in the early 

Chola temple in Punjai (Thanjavur district) of the time of Paran- 

taka І (Accn. A.D. 907), and on a pillar in the temple in Turaiyur 

(Tiruchirapalli district) of about A.D. 940. The other early mini- 

atures are found in the Koranganatha temple, Srinivasanallur in 

the same district, and also in a niche forana in the Tirumiyachur 

temple (Thanjavur district). It occurs as a niche sculpture in stone, 

perhaps for the first time, in the deyakoshtha of the south wall of 

the ardha-mandapa in the temple at Konerirajapuram (Thanjavur 

district) and become’ a usual feature in ‘that position in the other 

early Chola temples. 

^ The Vijayalaya Cholisvaram in Narttamalai (Pudukkottai dis- 

trict), though so called after the founder of the Chola line of 

Thanjavur, is an interesting and fine Muttaraiyar example. The

sandhara aditala of this tritala structure is square on plan exter- 

nally with an almost egual-sized closed mandapa in front, while its 

inner wall enclosing the sanctum is circular, leaving an intervening 

passage all round. The second zala rising over the inner circular 

wall is square, while the third, as also the griva and sikhara above, 

iscircular in section. The aditala hara; extended over the top of 

the front mandapa, also shows a series of dance sculptures. But 

for these and the dvarapalas at the mandapa entrance, the sculp- 

tures on the four faces at the top and the cylindrical Zinga with 

circular pitha in the sanctum, there are not many sculptures. The 

west-facing complex is surrounded by the ashta parivara and a 

prakara with a small gopura entrance on the east located near the 

north-east corner at the top of a slopy ascent on the rock over 

which the temple is built. 



The Muvarkovil at Kodumbalur (Tiruchirapalli district) is of 

Irukkuvel origin and has three equal-sized dvitala vimanas .square 

from base to sikhara with their ardha-mandapas standing in a 

north-south row facing west, with a common large and oblong 

maha-mandapa in front. Two of these are complete and the third 

is represented by its extant basement only. The whole was sur- 

rounded by sixteen sub-shrines and a prakara, with the small 

entrance gopuram on the west. This temple is another important 

landmark in the line of the great south Indian temples. It is built 

of fine-grained and neatly-dressed granite, and is noted for its 

exquisite sculptures—particularly Vinadhara, Dakshinamurti, 

Kalari Siva, and some feminine forms. 



Likewise, the early Chola temples of Koranganatha at Sriniva- 

sanallur (Tiruchirapalli district), Nagesvaram in Kumbakonam, 

Naltunai Isvara at Punjai and Brahmapurisvara in Pullamangai 

are other early all-stone temples famous for their sculpture of 

quality and grace including what appear to be portrait sculp- 

tures of men and women. Hundreds of such stone temples were 

being built in Tamil Nadu іп the centuries.before and after A.D. 

1000, in replacement, of earlier brick-and-timber structures, and 

in places hallowed by the memory ofthe Saiva and Vaishnava 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 125 





saints—the Nayanmars and the Alvars. 



Similar activity, though on a lesser scale, is to be found in the 

southern Mysore country, where the Western Gangas of Talkad 

havelefta few contemporary hard stone temples. The earliest 

would be the twin ekatala vimanas of: a small size forming an 

adjunct to the later Jain temple on the Chandragiri Hill in 

Sravana-Belagola (Hassan district). But the more impressive Jain 

temple on the same hill would be the Chamundaraya Basti (c. 

982-985), with a three-storeyed east-facing yimana and closed 

mandapa and open porch in front. Its two square lower talas of 

the superposed sanctum type, with a double-walled square san- 

dhara aditala leaving a passage in between the walls, are functional 

and have Tirthankara forms enshrined in their sanctums. The 

third tala, also square, is non-functional, and the griva and sikhara 

are octagonal. The hara of the aditala over the top of the outer 

wall, consisting of the kuta, sala and panjara elements, is continued 

over the top edges of the front mandapas. The second ‘storey has 

thus an open ambulatory round it. The hara contains a series of 

fine sculptures. 



But the most interesting monument in Sravana-Belagola is the 

hypaethral temple of the Gommatesvara colossus, 17.5 metres high, 

carved in the round out of a standing tor on top of the Indragiri 

Hill This was the work of Chavundaraya, the minister of Ganga 

Rachamalla (974-984). Being a free-standing image of fine propor- 



,tions and of polished granite, it is even more interesting than the 

colossus of Ramses II at Abu Simbel in Egypt. The base of the 

colossus is surrounded by a malika of granite, built by Gangaraya, 

the minister of Hoysala Vishnuvardhana (1110-1152), and the 

mandapa abutting the lower part of the colossus from behind was 

built by another minister, Baladeva, in the twelfth century. 



The Ganga temple at Kambadahalli near Sravana-Belagola, also 

Jain, is interesting on account of the fact that its three principal, 

vimanas of moderate dimensions and built wholly of granite open 

into the three sides of a common mandapa; the fourth side 

of which on the north affords the common outer entrance—a 





126 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





grouping called trikuta.“The three sguare-based vimanas have square, 

octagonal and circular: griva sikharas, respectively, denoting the 

_Nagara-Dravida-Vesara types as described in the Silpa texts. To 

this complex have been added two more lateral vimanas in front of 

the comnion mandapa of the trikuta nucleus. The whole is sur- 

-rounded by a prakara with a small gopura entrance on the north. 

This complex called. Panchakuta Basti (Jain temple) in Kamba- 

dahalli (Hassan district), besides being an unique combination óf 

‘units illustrating the ternary classification of the southern vimanas 

as Nagara, Dravida and Kesara, is interesting in its other aspects 

too. Particularly may be mentioned the variety of niche foranas- 

framing the devakoshthas, that depict the different forms of toranas 

described inthe texts and inscriptions, such as the patra torana, 

chitra torana, makara torana, vidyadhara torana, etc. This temple 

complex in thus exemplifying the various features: of the vimana 

form as enumerated and codified in the Silpa and Agama texts of 

the period, can be said to be а perfect text-book illustration or 

specimen to be studied in comparison with the texts. 



The granite temples of Nandi (Kolar districts), the capital of the 

Banas, are of Ganga-Nolamba extraction. The small and earlier 

Yoganandisvara on top of the hill is not architecturally impressive, 

while the larger twin temples of Bhoganandisvara and Aruna- 

chalesvara, both of the square type, at the foot of hill are. This 

nuclear twin is enlarged with the addition of later axial mandapas 

ard “peripheral structures into a complex with prakara and gopura. 

on the east. The Bhoganandisvara, earlier of the two, is evidently 

a renovation of a pre-existing structure, and is noted for the. fine- 

ness of its structure and beauty of its sculptures. The Arunachales- 

vara would appear to be almost a later copy of the Bhoganandis- 

vara. The ruined soft stonc-built temples at Hemavati (Anantapur 

district), noted for their fine sculpture, are examples of pure 





'Nolamba architecture and art. 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 127 

THE CHALUKYA-RASHTRAKUTA SERIES 





The structural experiments of the carly Chalukyas are found 

confined to their capital Vatapi (Badami), the adjacent Mahaku- 

tesvar, and the twin mercantile cities of Aihole and Patadkal (all 

in Bijapur district). In all of them the native soft sandstone of fine 

‘grain and quality which was most easily tractable has been used. 

This alone was responsible for the larger-sized structures using 

massive blocks in the construction and richness of figure sculpture. 



Before considering the well-known and typical vimana and 

prasada forms of temples of this series, it would'be good to consider 

briefly the few mandapa-type temples that came early in the series 

and were made after the early cave-temple model. They are the 

small temples in the Jyotirlinga group, the Ladkhan, the Kontgudi 

and the Meguti temples of Aihole. The two temples of the Jyotir- 

linga group are hardly more than mere mandapas with closed walls 





and flat terrace-tops, with an outer Nandi-mandapa of a similar size. 

The Ladkhan is a ponderous construction, essentially a large 





mandapa standing on a moulded adhishthana with four central 

pillars, surrounded by two concentric rows of successively lesser 

height, so that the flat roof over the centre is 2 raised clerestory, 

with the slab roofs sloping down on all the four sides over the 

outerrings of the shorter pillars. The inter-spaces between the 

outermost row of pillars, on the edge of the plinth are closed by 

slab screen waks, some of them with perforated window pattern, 

the walls extending on the front on either side with a central door- 

opening. The centrál bay at the rear end with a slopy roof is con- 

verted into a shrine chamber with a plinth and slab walls. Over the 

central clerestory has been constructed an upper cell of heavy slabs 

with flat roof. To the whole is added later, open pillared mukha- 

mandépa, transversely oblong, with carved pillars of the mandapa 

type, their bases connected by a seat having a lean back-rest 

over its rear edge—the kakshasana typical of Chalukyan temples 

and their derivatives. Thus it would appear to be no more than a 

‘large assembly hall converted into a temple with a shrine inside at 

the rear. The large. mandapa of the Ladkhan temple with its 





128 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





improvised shrine at the rear with an unconventional slopy roof 

standing on an adhishthana of its own was rightly suspected to have 

been originally the hall of the village moot (Percy Brown). Such 

assembly halls for the village elders to meet and transact business 

relating to local, social, administrative, judicial and religious 

matters were not uncommon, judging from the evidence of many 

inscriptions. A case in point will be what is nowadays called the 

Vaikunthaperumal temple in Uttiramerur (Chingleput district), a 

later Pallava structure, which we have not noticed in our preceding 

account of temples of the period. What isextant of this sabha- 

mandapa or grand assembly hall of Uttirameru-Chaturvedi manga- 

Jam, constructed, evidently, for the village sabha or assembly, is. 

only the magnificent, stone-built plinth, the upa-pitha and the 

adhishthana, the columned superstructure that stood over it having 

been lost. The extant moulded basement is in hard granite stone. 

The superstructure was perhaps walled оп all three sides with 

lion ог vyala-based hard stone pillars carrying: moulded capitals of 

soft stone (chloritic schist) on the facade over the front sopana. 

An inscription of the twenty-fourth year of Pallaya Nandivarman 

Ш, on the extant structure itself calls it a mandapa, not а 

temple (vimana). The structure is of the time of Dantivarman (А.р. 

196-846). Incidentally it carries the famous inscription of the 

twelfth and fourteenth years of Parantaka I Chola (А.р. 919-921), 

laying down the rules and conditions for eligibility in elections 

to and the manner of the constitution of the village assembly— 

perhaps the earliest inscription known as relating to elections to 

the village administrative bodies. Thus it was a village moot 

hall, a santhagara, even as the Ladkhan in Aihole was. It originally, 

like the Ladkhan, had a small shrine at the rear, now replaced by 

a much later one called Vaikunthaperumal. This contained 

the deity before which oaths were taken, deliberations made 

and decisions arrived at, the deity standing asthe divine wit- 

ness or sakshi bhuta. Such sabha-mandapas, associated with a 

Vishnu shrine are mentioned in the Silpa texts, such as Maya mata 

(9:73). The presence of a shrine for Vishnu, on the mandapa of the 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES —THE EARLY PHASE 129 





Vaikunthaperumal is referred to in an inscription of Pallava 

Kampavarman. The other mandapas of the large mercantile city of 

Aihole can be deemed to have served a similar purpose. 



The Kontgudi likewise, has a shrine at the rear wall of the hall 

and with the superstructural scheme added later since the roof 

shrine has the features of a more evolved Chalukyan vimana roof. 



The Meguti of Jain dedication with an inscription dated A.D. 

634 is better evolved. It is essentially a closed mandapa on a raised 

and moulded plinth with four central pillars and peripheral walis 

on all sides over the edge of the plinth and enclosing nine bays, 

onc central and eight peripheral. The walled central bay forms tlie 

main sanctum and also carries the roof shrine over it. The rear 

bays on either side, close to the hind wall coruers, provide for the 

two lateral shrines of the ground floor with the two lateral buys in 

front on the median axial line having flat roofs like the central cell, 

thus forming their respective ardha-mandapas. The three front bays 

form а transversely oblong mukha-mandapa for ali the three 

shrines. The three muk&a-mandapa bays in front as also the corres- 



‘ponding three at the rear have slopy roofs. The outer walls are 

relieved with three recesses, by pilasters, the relieved parts carry- 

ing derakoshtha niches. Some of the recesses have perforated 

windows. The inscription of A.D. 634 may not relate to the stone 

structure of Meguti as has come down to us, but to an earlier 

structure, perhaps of brickwork, to which the inscribed stone stele 

was attached, or, in front of which it stood. For, judging by the 

components of the adhishthana and the wall pilasters and their 

developed mouldings one can only attribute them, on comparison 

with what obtains in other cases in Aihole, Pattadkal and 

Badami, to a date posterior to the first half the seventh century. A 

parallel case will be that of the extant Mahakubesvar temple, 

Mahakuta, which, as a wholly stone-built structure, can only be 

posterior to the date of the free-standing Mahakuta pillar, or one 

that at best could have gone into the composition of a mandapa 

and not of a vimana. The present stone temple, of a later date than 



-the pillar, could have replaced an earlier brick structure that had 





130 Ў TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





the inscribed pillar in front of it. 

The plan and design of these odd-looking temples do, however, 





anticipate similar temples of later times on the west coast where 

owing to high rainfall slopy roofs were immensely suitable. As 

such, temples of this type became common there. The shrine 

located in the central bay had a raised roof and slopy side roofs 

all round. The central shrine was often of the Chaturmukha type as 

at the Chaturmukha Jain temple at Karkala. For other temples of 

such derivation, one has only to look at the many examples found 

in the region between Goa and Mangalore, if not further south, 

exemplified by the Ketapi Narayana temple at Bhatkal, or the 

Vaital temple at Keri in Goa. 



Coming to the typical vimana temples of the Chalukyas of 

Badami, we find that the earliest essays were confined to the out~ 

skirts of the capital Badami and adjoining Mahakutesvar. 



The Makutesvara temple, the main temple in the group formed 

of northern-and southern-type temples enclosed by a wall in Maha- 

kutesvar, was in fact existing from the time of Mangalesa—at the 

close of the sixth century—according to an inscription on a loose 

pillar (vijaya stambha) that stood in front of it and is now kept in 

the Bijapur Museum. The temple has been apparently redone in 

stone and later renovated, but it still retains much of the earlier 

characters. The aditala of the vimana is double-walled with a closed 

ambulatory in between. The external wall as also the adhishthana 

below are relieved on the centre of each side into bays with deva- 

ch side are provided with perforated 





koshthas. The recesses on ea 

windows set inside a frame of lateral pilasters and a top cornice or 





kapota of a prastara carrying miniature shrine elements as found in 

the hara of either the southern vimana typc.or they are of the 

northern prasada type, a rather advanced feature as again found in 

the devakoshthas of the Durga temple at Aihole. The square adirala 

outer wall carries on top over its prastara four karnakutas at the 

corners and four salas in between over tbe central bays of the wall. 

The adhishthana below is. extended forward and widened to form 

the base of the wider square mandapa in front. The central bays of 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 131 





its walls have devakoshthas for sculptures of Siva, as on the vímana 

wall, and the recesses have perforated windows. The second tala 

rising as an upward extension of the inner aditala wall is high and 

carries a similar hara of four karnakutas and four salas, while the 

octagonal griva and sikhara above have four large prominent kuta 

appligues. on the diagonal faces and concealing much of them, - 

while the intervening cardinal faces have nasika fronts. 



Standing at the south end of the Mahakutesvar enclosure and 

also facing east is the Mallikarjuna temple with a sandhara vimana, 

dvitala, of the same type as the Makutesvara, except for some 

minor variations of architectural detail and sculptural content. 

The griva and sikhara of this otherwise Square vimana are 

Octagonal. Both these temples show some advanced features such 

as the elaborately carved over-door of the shrine-entrance in addi- 

tion to theniche decoration already noticed, and in having a water- 

chute, or channel, on the floor of the shrine with an outlet opening 

on the northern side. 



The Malegitti Sivalaya standing on an outer crag among the 

hills of Badami is the simplest structure consisting of a ponderous- 

ly built single-walled nirandhara vimana coniposed of large blocks 

of sandstone, with a closed mandapa almost of the same width in 

front of it, preceded by an open four-pillared porch of a lesser 

width, all standing over a common moulded adhishthana. The hara 

of four karnakutas and four salas of the aditala of the vimana is 

extended over the mandapa in front, the two front vimana karna- 

kutas being also the rear karnakutas of the mandapa. The second 

tala of the vimana has a similar hara of four kutas and four salas. 

Four more large karnakutas closely adhere to the griya існага and 

conceal the corner faces of the octagonal griya, partially over- 

topping the squat dome of the octagonal sikhara and thereby lend- 

ing a peculiar appearance to this vimana. The cardinal faces of the 

griva have four nasikas of equal size. The three bays on the vimana 



Wall on each of its faces correspond, respectively, to the two 

extreme karnakutas and central sala, with plain rectangular niches 

for sculptures of deities. Likewise, the two lateral walls of the 





132 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





mandapa are relieved five times, corresponding to the kara elements, 

the central one on each side being a devakoshtha which is again 

found on either wing of the front eastern wall on either side of 

the shrine-entrance. The extreme recesses on the north and south 

of each lateral face of the mandapa wall have perforated windows. 



The Lower Sivalaya (so called for want of any other name) in 

Badami fort, which was perhaps originally dedicated to Vishnu, is 

a smaller structure almost similar to the Malegitti Sivalaya, but 

differing from it in one important respect, namely, that its aditala 

is double-walled, or sandhara. The hara elements are present over 

all the falas and the griya and sikhara are octagonal with applique 

kutas. Р 



The Upper Sivalaya, a little higher up on the hill within the fort 

at Badami, has a sandhara vimana square on plan, with. the outer 

wall of the vimana aditala extended forwards over the similarly 

extended adhishthana to enclose a large mandapa. The mandapa is 

closed and pillared inside, with a central nave under a flat roof of 

the same width as the shrine behind. Two lateral aisles form the 

forward continuation of the circumambulatory passage between 

the double walls of the vimana aditalg, with slopy roofs, as in the 

case of the ambulatory passage also. The external walls of the 

aditala and front mandapa are alternately relieved and recessed and 

the bays are cantoned by pilasters, to correspond with the widely 

spaced hara elements on top of their prastara. The recesses have 

shorter pilasters, topped by the kudu arches of the cornice of the 

prastara. The second tala is tall, rising as an upward extension of 

the aditala inner wall. It does not carry the hara over its top. The 

third fala of a lesser height over itis also devoid of the hara ele- 

ments. The griva and sikhara are square, like the rest of the vimana 

below, and are not encumbered by applique kutas, as in the other 

cases. 1 



In contrast with this group оѓ earlier vimana forms showing diffe- 

rent stages of development duringthe seventh century, we have: 

the ‘full-fledged vimana forms in the temples of Sangamesvara, 

Virupaksha, aad Mallikarjuna in Patadkal, reflecting to a great. 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 133 





extent the vimana features as crystallised in the contemporary 

Pallava structural temples and their earlier monolithic rathas. The 

Sangamesvara is the earliest of the three and was built by Chalukya 

Vijayaditya (A.D. 697-733) and is nearer the Pallava form than any 

other, in that it has no sukanasika or gable-like projecting appen- 

dage from the front of the upper talas and griva sikhara region of 

the vimana over the top of the antarala or ardha-mandapa fronting 

the shrine below. The other two, namely, the Virupaksha built by 

the queen of Vikramaditya II (A.D. 733-746), and the Mallikarjuna 

built by another queen soon after, have the sukanasika forming 

the earliest of the Chalukyan vimana series that possess this charac- 

teristic architectural member, as does the later Kailasa monolith at 

Ellora. The Sangamesvara and the Virupaksha are both similar to 

each other in having a square plan from the base to the apex, and 

are hence of the Nagara order. The Mallikarjuna has a circular 

griya and sikhara over-topping the square talas, and is hence of 

the Vesara order. 



The Sangamesvara vimana, which is tritala, has a double-walled 

sandhara aditala, with the outer wall extended forward to form 

the ardha-mandapa over the similarly extended adhishthana and 

widening beyond to form the closed maha-mandapa with four rows 

of five pillars each inside. An open pillared porch is attached to 

the middle of the northern side of the maha-mandapa. The exterior 

of this wall relieved and recessed alternately has a series of deva- 

-Koshthas in the bays containing sculptures of deities of varied 

iconography. The prastara over this outer wall of the vimana and 

its forward mandapa wall extension carries a hara of karnakutas 

and salas corresponding to the relieved bays below. At the centre 

of each side the hara is pierced by water-outlets of the terrace. 

Over them the hara part carries incipient panjaras, perhaps the first 

appearance of this third characteristic member in the vimanas of 

the Chalukyas and their derivatives. The second tala too, which is 

an upward projection of the inner wall of the aditala, carries a 

hara of four karnakutas and four salas, while the third tala has 

four salas only on the cardinal sides, coming in front of the 





134 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





nasika projections of the griva and sikhara region. The absence of 

tbe karnakutas in the hara of the top tala marks the first step to- 

wards the elimination of the hara itself, and the placement of the 

vahanas and lanchanas of the main deity at the corners in its place. 

This is a significant change that occurred almost at the same time, 

if not slightly earlier, in the Pallava temples as in the Shore tem- 

ple and the Kailasanatha of Kanchi. The Sangamesvara establishes 

another landmark in that it has in its scheme two" side shrines in 

the ardha-mandapa at its two ends, on either side of the sanctum 

entrance dedicated to Durga and Ganapati. 



The Virupaksha is the largest structural temple complex of the! 

early Chalukyas consisting of a tall four-storeyed vimana with 

axial mandapas and peripheral two-storeyed parivara sub-shrines 

of the kuta and sala type round the court, the whole enclosed by 

a prakara wall with gopura entrances in front and behind on the 

east and west, which are again the earliest in the Chalükyan series. 

The square vimana has a sandhara aditala, the outer wall of which, 

as also the adhishthana below, is thrown out into five bays and 

four recesses on each side. They are of varying widths correspond- 

ing to their corner karnakutas, central salas, and intervening 

panjaras of the hara over the prastara of that side. The mandapa 

js multi-pillared with massive sculptured columns and has three 

openings with projected pillared porches on its three sides—east, 

north and south. The salas of the hara on top of the mandapa 

prastara that come over these three entrances, as in the Kailasa of 

Ellora, are rendered larger in dimensions than the rest of the hara 

elements in order to simulate miniature gopuradvaras. The deva- 

koshtha niches accommodated between pilasters cantoning the 

relieved bays have varied sculptures set inside kuta, panjara or 

forana frames. The ardha-mandapa has shrines inside for Durga and 

Ganesa. The second zala carries four karnakutas and three 

salas over its prastara on three sides. The third smaller storey of 

lesser height likewise has four karnakutas and three salas, the 

front of both talas projected over-the antarala as the tiered 

sukanasika which in design is of the form of a multi-storeyed 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 135 





apsidal shrine with an appropriate front. The fourth storey, still 

smaller, carries only four karnakutas in its hara from which the four 

salas have been eliminated, as in the Pandya Talinatha temple іп 

Tirupattur, exposing to full view the four nasikas of the griva 

sikhara region. The prakara wall has overits coping a series of 

kutas and salas, as over the prakara of the larger vimana of the 

Pallava Shore temple. 



The Mallikarjuna built close to the Virupaksha is a smaller 

temple with a four-storeyed vimana square in all its talas. The 

griva and sikhara above are circular. It has also a prominent suka- 

nasika projected forward from its upper talas. The topmost tala 

has no kara at all, marking the stage of the total elimination of 

this element, and heralding the advent of the characteristic vahanas, 





or symbols appropriate to the dedication of the main sanctum. 

The Durga temple at Aihole is essentially of the southern 





variety of the apsidal or gaja-prishtha form with an odd, clumsily- 

fitted northern-type square sikhara which would be aberrant if of 

original design or incongruous and inapt if a later addition. The 

shrine and its axial mandapas stand raised with their adhishthana 

built over a sub-base, a feature not common in the earlier temples 

considered above, but usual in later temples of both Chalukyan 

and Pallava-Pandya derivation. The moulded upa-pitha is apsidal in 

plan and carries a peripheral row of heavy mandapa-type pillars on 

its edge that surround the moulded adhishthana and the outer wall 

of the apsidal sandhara aditala of the vimana proper and its for- 

ward projection, as the closed antarala mandapa of equal width, 

and also the frontal agra-mandapa on the forward extension of the 

same adhishthana at which region it narrows. Thus, the platform on 

top of the upa-pitha forms a covered outer ambulatory with а slopy 





roof, spanning the gap between the outer wall of the vimana and 

axial mandapas оп one side and the pillars set on the edgeon the 





other. The upa-pitha terminates in front as a still narrower land- 

ing platform with lateral flights of steps and a frontal banister. 

These periphers' pillars of the front mandapa section and 

those at the font or eastern end on either side of the inner

edge of the landing have large statuary carved on them, 

while the rest are devoid of such embellishment. They are all 

interconnected by kakshasanas or seats with lean-back rests, as 

is common in Chalukyan structures. The adhishthana, as also 

the outer wall over it, are thrown out at intervals into eleven 

bays, three on each linear side walls, three more round the rear 

apse end, and two in front, where the wall turns in to embrace 

the front doorway of the antarala-mandapa flanking the entrance. 

These eleven bays carry devakoshthas, the niches of which are 

framed by shrine-fronts of all patterns of southern-style vimanas 

and northern-style prasadas—such as the kura, sala or koshtha, 

panjara, udgama (coalesced kudu-like arches), and forana, and 

containing bold sculptures of gods. This much developed feature 

is coupled with the presence of a prominently projecting pranala 

or gargoyle-like water-spout over the adhisthana level on the nor- 

thern side at the apse end of the outer wall. This is in continuation 

of the water-channel leading from the floor of the cella and pas- 

sing through the base of the inner wall and the sandhara ambula- 

tory. All this indicates a later date for this temple than is usually 

assumed, not to speak of other advanced features like the diverse 

corbel forms, the style of sculpture, the presence of the upa-pitha, 

etc. These and the presence of an inscription of Chalukya Vikram- 

aditya II (A.D. 733-746) on the ruined outer gopura at the south- 

eastern part оѓ the prakara indicate a date early in the first quarter 

of the eighth century. The inner wall of a typical short apse or 

chapa form encloses the cella. In forward alignment with its two 

linear side walls are two rows of four pillars each inside the 

antarala-mandapa dividing the space into a central nave with a 

raised flat clerestory roof and two lateral aisles with lower slopy 

slab roofs projected over the still lower slopy roof of the outer 

circuit. The chapa ends of the inner wall of the aditala are turned 

in to form the narrow front eritrance of the antarala-mandapa. T. he 

agra-mandapa has four pillars set on the edge of the forward end 

‘of the adhishthana with a raised clerestory roof in continuation 

of the one at its rear. The aisles of the antarala are continuous 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 137 





with the inner circumambulatory between the two walls round the 

sanctum. The sanctum is empty for a circular pitha. Its original 

dedication is uncertain. The name Durga for the temple is mis- 

leading since it was evidently not dedicated to that goddess. This 

may be due to the fact that till the earlier part of the last century, 

the temple formed part of a fortification (durga or durgam) with a 

rubble defence work on top of the temple, probably of the 

Marathas. If the incongruous superstructure of the northern - 

.prasada-type is not original, the sanctum might have been either 

flat-roofed or might have had an apsidal roof of the pattern of 

Ter and Chezerla apsidal temples. 



Coming to the Rashtrakuta phase of this early period commenc- 

ing with the last quarter of the eighth century, we have, as a good 

example, the ruined Jain vimana temple standing on the outskirts 

of Patadkal. It is essentially a three-storeyed sandhara vimana, 

square on plan from its base to sikhara, the two lower storeys 

being functional. The kudu motifs on the cornice or kapota tier of 

the adhishthana have lost their original nasika shape and have 

become flat triangular reliefs, precursors of the dentil reliefs of 

the later Chalukyan and Hoysala temples. The pillar capitals too 

have lost their original shape and robustness and are transformed 

into mere conventional shapes found in the later Chalukyan tem- 

ples. The navaranga-mandapa in front of the aditala and connected 

with it by a short antarala shows on its walls seven bays with six 

intervening recesses, adorned with nasika forms containing the 

seated Jinas and other figures. The prastara carries a hara of kutas, 

salas and panjaras. The second tala has a sanctum enclosed by the. 

upward extension of the inner wall of the aditala. Its antarala front 

is masked by the basal part of the sukanasika, while the prastara 

-on the other three sides carries four karnakutas and three salas, 

there being no scope for a sala on the front side because of the 

-Sukanasika. The third storey of some lesser width is relieved on its 



- sides’ except on the front or sukanasika side. The bays contain 

udgama motifs as in northern-style temples. The square sikhara 

“following the same scheme of offsetting simulates a twelve-ribbed 





138 TEMPLES OF.SOUTH INDIA 





member heralding similar modifications in the later Chalukyan tem- 

ples. In front of the navaranga is the open multi-pillared mukha- 

mandapa, the peripheral row having interposed kakshasanas. Ex- 

cept the two innermost pillars of peripheral series abutting on the 

nayaranga front, all others, as well as the four central ones, though 

in sandstone, are partially lathe-turned beralding the more com- 



_ pletely lathe-turned pillars of schist or soap-stone of the later: 

Chalukyas and their successors. 



The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, a collateral branch of the 

early Chalukyas of Badami, however, have left a series of structu- 

ral temples in sandstone which are more akin in their style to the 



"Pallava style of Tondaimandalam to their south. Among these, the 

temples at Biccavolu (east Godavari district) are characteristic. 

The Bictavolu series falls into two groups. The earlier one com- 

prises the temples called Kansaragudi, Nakkalagudi and a third 

having no local name, all built, perhaps in the time of -Gunaga 

Vijayaditya (848-891) and his successors. They are all square on 

plan, three-storeyed tritala Nagara vimanas with four karanakutas. 

and four salas intervening on the aditala and second tala prastaras, 

without panjaras and devoid of the sukanasika. These features in- 

dicate affinity and proximity to the Pallava type, though their 

distinct regional and parental Chalukyan traits! would be evident 

from the other features and the general stature of the vimana 

form. The makara toranas show great emphasis in their detail, 

particularly by the addition of a pair of makara-heads at the apex 

of the arch on either side of the finial. The pilasters are four-sided 

as usual in all early temples, with full capitals of the “order”. The 

kudus in the flexed cornice, or kapota, are horse-shoe-shaped as in 

the Pallava and early Chalukyan examples. The other three tem- 

ples inside the village—the Golingesvara, the Chandrasekhara, and 

the Rajarajesvara—would belong to the second and later group 

(c- 950-1050), and the last perhaps to the time of Rajaraja 

‘Narendra (1019-1060). They are also two- or three-storeyed Nagara 

vimanas, square on plan, but with tbeir superstructures entirely 

or partially restored in later times and heavily plastered over, 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE EARLY PHASE 139 





obscuring many original diagnostic features. These temples have 

all a typically Chalukyan plinth form, with nirandhara or single- 

walled aditala and with a narrower ardha-mandapa in front. The 



` niche sculptures are all Saivite. The sikhara is square as also the 

griya. In some cases, as in the Rajarajesvara, the talas are devoid 

of the hara over the prastara, a feature that became common in the 

later temples of the Andhra coast. The sikhara form of the earlier 

group shows affinity to the Upper Sivalaya form at Badami. 





CHAPTER VII 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES-- 

THE MIDDLE PHASE 





BY ABOUT A.D. 1000, imperial Chola power had reached its zenith, 

its authority having spread over the entire Tamil region and 

Kerala, parts of south Mysore and coastal Andhra, and even over- 

seas to Sri Lanka, the Andamans, the Laccadives and the Maldives. 

The contemporary rival power, the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan, 

soon gave way to the resurgent Chalukyas of Kalyani, the Western 

Chalukyas or later Chalukyas, as they are often called. With the 

experience and knowhow acquired in stone construction, technique 

and design, and with the forms and norms crystallised into codified 

Agama and Silpa manuals, the period that followed witnessed 

great activity in the construction of temples, particularly the great 

ones of south India and Sri Lanka. A great number of new temples 

were built by the Chola emperor, Rajarajachola I the Great (985- 

1014), his elder sister, queens and vassal chiefs, and some more 

still by the dowager queen, Sembiyan Mahadevi, the queen of the 

pious Gandaraditya Chola, the grand uncle of Rajaraja I. 





THE CHOLA AND THE LATER PANDYA SERIES 





The Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur closely followed by the 

Brihadisvara at Gangaikendacholapuram (Tiruchirapalli district) 

mark the acme of the southern vimana architecture—in magnitude, 

quality of design, technique and embellishment. The great temple 

at Thanjavur, appropriately called the Brihadisvara, or the Raja- 

тајеѕүага after its builder Rajaraja I, conceived as a whole complex 

on a grand scale and completed by the founder, constitutes the 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE. 141 





most ambitious undertaking and achievement of the: Tamilian 

architect. It combines all that is best in temple-building tradition 

— architecture, sculpture, painting and allied arts. It is a large 

complex with an enormous monolithic Nandi recumbent on a high 

pedestal in front of the vimana and its coeval axial mandapas, but 

now shelteréd in a mandapa of a much later date. It has the loftiest 

known or achieved vimana, 66m high, standing over a basal 

square one side of which is about 28m in length and which, in 

due proportion to the elevation, forms an appropriately broad, 

high and amply moulded upa-pitha platform, on which the boldly 

moulded adhishthana of the east-facing pyramidal vimana rests. 

` The same upa-pitha and adhishthana are extended forward as basal 

structures of the axially placed ardha-, maha- and mukha-mandapas, 

connected to the main vimana by a north-south transept across the 

ardha-mandapa, reached from either side by flights of steps over 

the heights of the upa-pitha and adhishthana. The pillard maha- and 

mukha-mandapas are closed on their sides, the rows of pillars in- 

side forming a central nave and lateral aisles which, in the maha- 

mandapa part, are raised as a continuous platform on either side 

of the central passage formed by the nave. The structure of pillars 

"and roof over the frontal landing, constituting an open porch, or 

agra-mandapa, are later replacements over the original adhishthana 

and upa-pitha with a flight of steps added in front in addition to 

the two original ones on the sides. While the transversely designed 

mukha-mandapa as also the connecting transept rise in four storeys, 

the maha-mandapa was originally three-storeyed. The top storey 

was evidently an open terrace, with а TOW of Nandis placed on 

the coping of its walls. 



The basal part of the vimana enclosing the garbha-griha is o£ 

two talas and is double-walled in the sandhara mode, each of the 

walls, outer and inner, of the same thickness and very massive. 

The outer wall rising-vertically to a height of about 15m is mark- 

ed externally into two storeys, lower and upper, by a dividing 

prastara line marked horizontally by the bold cornice and the cen- 

trally-placed additional doorways, complete with jambs, lintel and 





142 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





sill on each of the visible sides, south, west and north, the vimana 

being an east-facing one. These two walls enclose inner circumam- 

bulatories in two tiers, since the inner wall of the sanctum too 

rises vertically to the same height of two storeys, in order to 

accommodate the colossal linga, and its equally immense linga- 

pitha in the sanctum. The outer wall, like the adhishthana below, is 

externally relieved into five bays on each face, the central ones on 

the south, west and north having the large door-openings in two 

tiers, one over the other, for both storeys of the inner circumam- 

bulatory. These along with the two superimposed larger or main 

doorways on the east make the vimana а chaumukh or chaturmukha 

structure, described as sarvatobhadra in the texts. In front on the 

east, the massiveness of the walls pierced behind the main doorway 

provides the antarala passage across the sandhara circuit leading 

to the inner doorway of the sanctum. In front of this. antarala is 

laid the north-south transept with flights of steps at either end, 





north and south, described above. 

The outer doorway is flanked by two colossal, drarapalas as are 





the outer entrances too. The central bays of the outer wails, which 

are the widest with door-openings, ‘have, at the top, over the 

prastara of the second tala, the targest central sala of the hara of 

that side. The extreme bays forming the respective corners and of 

middling width have on top the karnakutas. The intermediate bays 

of least width have the panjaras at their top, thus constituting the 

full hara of aedicules over the second tala prastara. The hara over 

the aditala is thus eliminated. The bays on either side of the cen- 

tral one with a door-opening are full-fledged devakoshthas contain- 

ing fine and bold sculptures, inside, of various deities. The Puranic 

legend associated with the iconograpy of each niche figure is indi- 

cated by small cameos in a synoptic manner on the jambs on 

either side of the main sculpture, an innovation seen for the first 

time during the early Chola period. The four intervening ‘recesses, 

or wall spaces, are each filled up by the ‘decorative pilaster’ motif 

which,is a short pilaster, carrying a shrine motif—panjara front— 

on top, a motif characterfitic of the period. The main pilasters 





Ld 

STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 143 





‘cantoning the.corners of the bays and their angles with the walls 

are square in section with full capitals. The abacus, or phalaka, as 

in earlier Pallava capitals, is large, massive and square, but the 

corbel or potika arms are bevelled with a central triangular tenon 

on the bevelled face. 



. The inner wall of the lower storey has on its three sides, in the. 

recesses between immense pilasters and opposite to the outer wall 

openings, more than life-size sculptures of Siva seated on the south, 

dancing on the west, and of Devi seated on the north. This lower 

ambulatory contains, over the rest of the inner wall and over the 

pilasters and ceilings and also over the inner face of the outer wall, 

extensive mural paintings of the Chola period, overlaid by later 

palimpsests of the Nayaka period in the seventeenth century. The 

Chola layer has been exposed wherever extant by peeling off the 

damaged Nayaka layer to reveal its richness. The most important 

themes occupying almost entire wings of the inner wall space are 

the panel representing Siva as Tripyrantaka (setting out for his 

fight with the Tripura demons), the panel narrating the story of 

the Saiva saint Sundaramurti Nayanar, and the panel representing 

the Chera king worshipping at the shrine of Nataraja of Chidamba- 

ram; along with his queens and his retinue. Other paintings of 

dancers, musicians, birds, animals, etc. are interesting. After the 

earlier paintings of an extensive nature in the Buddhist caves at 

Ajanta arid the smaller area of paintings in the Jain cave-temple at 

Sittannavasal, these are the only other'extensive series of guality > 

forming an important landmark in the history of Indian mural 

painting. The second tala circumambulatory is equally interesting, 

for on its inner wall face at its middle height are blocked out one 

hundred and eight sguare panels running as a belt right round, all 

except the last. twenty-seven with completed reliefs showing Siva, 

four-armed, ‘demonstrating the various karanas, or dance poses, as 

enumerated in Bharata’s Natyashastra. 



By a system of inward corbelling or offsetting of the successive 

inner courses of the two opposing faces of the two walls, ог kada- 

lika karqna—a system commonly adopted i in Indian architecture to 





144 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





bridge spaces as an alternative to true arching or vaulting—the 

two walls are made to meet at the top level of the third storey, 

from which point rises the rest of the pyramidal superstructure of 

the eleven further gradually receding talas of this soaring vimana 

in all of sixteen stages from the upa-pitha, almost the traditional 

maximum. Each tala carries over its prastara a hara of kutas, salas 

and panjaras. The topmost tala has instead four Nandis placed at 

the four corners with the octagonal griva and sikhara rising up 

from the midst. The topmost stones closing the ultimate gap alone 

is estimated from their size to weigh 80 tons (81.3 metric tonnes). 

The stupi, as originally intended by Rajaraja, and as stated in 

his inscription in the temple, is of copper, gilt with gold and is 

3.82m high. The entire interior of the pyramid from its base to 

apek is rendered hollow by the gradual inward offsetting of the 

successive courses of masonry in the kadalika karana mode. On 

the front side the storeys up to the level of the fifth tala are slight- 

ly extended forward over the antarala of the two lowermost vertical 

talas, in the form of what is called a mukha sala, or mukha bhadra, 

in order to take in these passages also in the organic scheme of 

the vimana, which is the largest mukhya vimana of the Dravida 

order. 



From the top of the adhishthana at about the middle of the 

northern side, an immense and carved water-spout is projected 

which discharges the abhisheka water flowing out of the sanctum 

floor. The water goes along the chutes running through the bases 

of the two walls and along the floor of the sandhara circumambu- 

latory in between. The lengthy pranala, or spout, is supported on 

the head of a bhuta squatting over the upa-pitha platform, blowing 

a conch. Opposite to this pranala and a little to the east is built 

the coeval square vimana for Chandikesvara, the seneschal of the 

Siva temple. This position located by Rajaraja in his great temple | 

became the norm for all Siva temples of subsequent periods. 



Enclosing the wide open court around the vimana and its axial 

mandapas, including the Nandi pavilion, is a two-tiered prakara 

wall of the same period. The tiers are demarcated externally by a 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 145 





horizontal kapota running at middle height, while both the tiers 

are sectioned by carved pilasters at intervals. On the middle of the 

eastern side the prakara has a massive gopura built entirely of 

stone. Ranged inside the prakara wall and built against it is a con- 

tinuous double-storeyed cloister, or malika, with a third open 

terrace on top, interrupted at the four corners and the middle of 

the three sides by seven square tritala-vimanas with octagonal 

griva sikhara. These are dedicated to the eight dikpalas, or guar- 

dians of the guarters: Agni, Yama, Niruti, Varuna, Vayu, Soma 

and Isana, from the south-east round to the north-east. The shrine 

for the eighth dikpala, Indra, and also another for Surya, merge 

into the inner face of the vertical base of the gopura on the cast. 

For the rest, the cloister is divided by a row of pillars aligned 

behind the facade columns into a frontal continuous corridor and 

a rear section stringing a series of thirty-six, two- and  three-stor- 

eyed shrines, all except those of the dikpalas with flat roofs of the 

mandapa type. On top of the prakara wall are ranged a row of 

Nandis. In the front of the gopura and at some distance away 

from it is a second outer and larger gopura, perhaps going with an 

outer prakara wall originally, but now incorporated into the de- 

fensive fort-wall of much latér times. In addition to the inner 

gopura, the prakara wall is pierced by three additional smaller 

entrances of the forana gate variety, placed opposite the centre of 

the south, west and north sides of the main vimana.. These are 

framed by simple over-doors with sakhas and crowned by. horizon- 

tal lintels. Е 

The Brihadisvara truly great in all respects, as its devout and 

victorious royal builder conceived it to be, is thus a repository of 

every branch of art—architecture, sculpture in stone and copper, 

iconography, painting, dance and music, jewellery, lapidary, etc. 

The numerous Sanskrit and Tamil epigraphs inscribed on itare in 

fine calligraphy. Some of them relate to the dedication of metal 

images of various deities with details of their forms and appear- 

ances, their measurements and weights. Some of these images are 

extant. Others describe the various ornaments, with details of 





\ 





146 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





weights of gold and gems, their variety and quality, the manner of 

their setting, the weight of lac and the strings used. The measure- 

ments of lands endowed are given to the fraction of units. All 

these would only show how meticulous the emperor was in matters 

relating to his great temple. | 

The other structures inside the court of this temple are the 

south-facing Amman temple, or the Devi-shrine unit of Brihan- 

nayaki, the consort of Brihadisvara, located to the north of 

Nandi, with the vimana having sala sikhara and axial mandapas, 

the adjoining sabha-mandapa for Nataraja also facing south, .and 

the east-facing Ganesa and Subrahmanya temple units on the 

south-west and north-west of the court. All these are all later 

additions to this complex, the last one pertaining to the Nayaka 

period.” ~ j ; ў 

This magnum opus of the Cholas started іп 1003, and still 

incomplete in a few of its details, was closely followed, within 

about twenty years, by another magnificent Chola structure, also 

called the Brihadisvara, built almost on the same plan and design 

by Rajendra I Chola (1012-1014), the great son and worthy. succes- 

sor of Rajaraja. The venue of this great temple was chosen in the 

newly found capital of Gangaikondacholapuram (Tiruchirapalli 

district), so named after the title of the king signifying his con- 

quests and successful expedition up to the Ganga. This temple 

complex had only two entrances, a gopura (now shattered) on the 

east and a plain double-storeyed forana gate on the north. While 

a great part of the stone enclosure wall, gopura, two-storeyed 

malika, and sub-shrines and mandapas were blasted and pulled 

down in the last century to supply stones for constructing a river 

dam in the neighbourhood, «ће main vimana and its axial man- 





_dapas, and two or three lesser vimana units in the court have for- 





tunately been spared and are even now almost intact. ‘The vimana 

is of a lesser height and smaller dimensions than its predecessor 

and model at Thanjavur, but the sculpture on the wall ‘niches, bold 

and almost cut-out in the round, is perhaps of greater excellence. 

‘The square vimana with a boldly moulded adhishthana over a high 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 147 





-upa-pitha is likewise sandhara in its two vertical lower falas. The 

Brihadisvara Vimana of Gangaikondacholapuram differs from its 

predecessor and supposed model of the same name in Thanjavur 

in one important respect. It has only a single entrance on the east, 

on both the functional lower storeys and is not chaturmukha or 

sarvatobhadra as the Thanjavur temple is. The tapering superstruc- 

ture of further talas resting on the third fala, rendered in a similar 

kadalika kana mode, assumes an embowed outline at the corners 

in -contrast to the severely straight corner lines of the Thanjavur 

Vimana. This is an aesthetic achievement, resulting from the clever 

interposition of octagonal kutas in the hara elements of the upper 

talas as karnakutas at the corners. Externally this vimana may be 

said to excel its predecessor in the matter of quality, fineness and 

variety of bold sculpture, as also the more aesthetic design of its 

superstructure. Internally, however, it lacks the other embellish- 

ments, namely, the paintings and depiction of dances. The smaller 

temple units, called the Uttara Kailasa and Dakshina Kailasa on 

either side of the main vimana, also belong to about the same 

P wholly apsidal and multi-storeyed main vimana, built of 

black-stone of the Tiruvorriyur temple near Madras, is another 

fine temple, though it is a smaller structure of Rajendra I Chola. 

The foundation inscription is interesting in that it defines the type 

of stone used as krishna-sila (black-stone), gives an account of the 

angas or parts of the vimana by which it was embellished, and also 

the name of the architect-designer. Following this, a number of 

wholly apsidal temples or temples with four-sided aditala and 





apsidal superstructure and griva sikhara continued to be built in 

this part of Tamil Nadu—Tondaimandalam in later Chola times 

and succeeding periods. Such temples are rather rare in the Chola 





Pandimandalams further south. А 

S Rajarajesvara, now. called Airavatesvara, at Darasuram, 





builtby Chola Rajaraja П (1 146-1173), and the Kampaharesvara 

at Tribhuvanam, built by Chola Kulottunga Ш (1178-1223) (both 

in Thanjavur district) are the last great temples of tlic later 





148 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Cholas with all-stone vimanas that were built before the later 

Pandyas supplanted them by the middle of the thirteenth century. 

These two are essentially lesser versions of the two Brihadisvara 

Vimanas, but incorporate in their design some variations and inno-, 

vations revealing an amount of Chalukya-Rashtrakuta influence. 

The Airavatesvara exhibits in its five tala vimana superstructure, a 

clever variation of the corner elements in the fala haras which are. 

square, octagonal and circular karnakutas conforming to the 

Nagara, Dravida and Vesara types; beside, there are also panjaras 

of the apsidal Vesara type turned sideways in one of the lower tala 

corners. The topmost tala carries four square karnakutas, again 

flanked by a pair of recumbent Nandis, one on either side. This 

feature is an innovation made by Chola Rajendra I in his later 

temples. It persisted for about a century in some temples and dis- 

appeared, as before, leaving the place for Nandis alone. But at the 

same time this temple of Rajaraja II heralds the idea of placing 

paired Nandis or similar vahanas or lanchanas appropriate in other 

temples —which in later times were placed back to back, or coales- 

cent with single-neck and head—at the corner, with two indepen- 

dent bodies along the two sides. Another feature found abandoned 

in the post-Pallava temples and earlier Chola temples, but persisting 

throughout in the Chalukyan'series of temples, and found again in 

this temple, is the extension of the hara of kuras, salas and panja- 

ras over the tops of the axial mandapas beyond the transept in 

front of the aditala, The main axial tomplex of vimana and man- 

dapas is similar to the plan in the Brihadisvara. Though it is lesser 

in dimensions, it is more ornate with bold and round sculpture in 

the niches and cameos of Puranic scenes formed by miniature 

panels. The one forming a belt round the base. of the vimana walls 

is noteworthy in that it narrates synoptically the stories of the 

lives of the 63 Saiva Nayanmars according to the ‘work called 

Periyapuranam. The larger loose sculptures set in the wall-niches 

and in the malika corridors are in a new medium, namely, a black, 

polished basalt-like stone, as against the'granite of the structure. 

They are all sculptures of a fine quality and most of them arc now 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 149 





removed and exhibited in the Thanjavur Art Gallery. The closed 

maha-mandapa of this east-facing complex has-an open porch-like 

agra-mandapa on its south, with ornately carved pillars having 

panel sculptures. The porch mandapa itself is designed to simulate 

a chariot on wheels drawn by horses, while the flights of steps, 

fore and aft, have balustrades guarded by elephants. 



On the northern side of the maha-mandapa is the improvised 

Amman shrine for the Devi, consort of the presiding deity. The 

whole is surrounded by a prakara with a storeyed malika. corridor 

running round inside and a storeyed gopura in front. Outside this 

gopura is the ornate but small Nandi-mandapa. Beyond is another 

Outer gopura that fronted a now non-existent outer prakara. 



The Deivanayaki Amman temple in a separate enclosure with 

a front gopura on the north of the Airávatesvara complex is also 

coeval, and the storeyed superstructure of the vimana carries a 

sala sikhara appropriate to Devi temples. The pilasters cantoning 

the walls of the aditala are yyala-based, as in the Rajasimha 

Pallava temples of much earlier times. 



The Kampaharesvara is much similar to the Airavatesvara, 

including its wheeled .porch-mandapa, an extension of the hara 

elements over the axial mandapas in front of the vimana aditala: 

and the Amman or Devi and Chandikesvara Vimanas being coeval 

with cach other. This temple too is a.veritable museum of sculp- 

tures of varied iconography that include some fine dance poses. 

Of the coeval main gopuras, the inner one in front and the rear 

ones are ruined on top, and the taller outer-front gopura has the 

characteristic squat shape of the period. 



The series of temples of this later Chola and later Pandya 

periods, terminated by the disruption brought about by the brief 

Muslim invasion and revival under the Vijayanagar Empire of 

the south, often revert to the system of brick-building for the 

superstructural falas over the stone body of the vimanas and 



gopuras, the mandapas alone being wholly of stone. The temples 

of this and subsequent periods incorporate in the original plan 

and composition of the temple complex the new and significant

addition brought into vogue late in the time of Rajendra I Chola, 

namely, the Tirukkamakottam, or Amman shrine as itis called in 

Saiva temples, or Tayarsannadhi in Vaishnava temples, that 

formed the unique feature of all temples: of Tamil Nadu and of 

Tamilian-built temples elsewhere. For example, there is a Visal- 

akshi temple built by the Tamils for the consort of Lord Visvesvara 

at Kasi-Varanasi. These also came to be built in the precincts of, 

or adjoining to, earlier built temples that originally did not pos- 

sess them; as, for example, the Thanjavur Brihadisvara. Assigned 

a definite location in the complex, it is a separate vimana with a 

sala sikhara dedicated to Devi as the divine consort of the/presid- 

ing deity in the main vimana, receiving equal importance in the 

rituals of worship and in the festivals. Thus, in accordance with 

the local names for the main deity, the Devi consort has an appro- 

priate name, e.g. Brihadisvara-Brihannayaki, Sundaresvara-Min- 

akshi, etc. 





The gopuras of the temple complex, in front and ip rear, as also 

often on the sides of the multiple prakaras, become more pro- 

minent by their greater size, often overtopping the main vimana in 

height. The gopuras added to already existing temples by the later ' 

Cholas, the later Pandyas, and the contemporary Pallavaraya 

chieftains and others are many. The Hoysalas too, when they came 

to occupy a part of Tamil Nadu in the last days of the later 

Cholas, left some significant gopuras, as, for example, the Ballala 

Gopura at Tiruvannamalai. The Pallavara Gopuras of Ko-Perun- 

jinga at Chidambaram, Vridhdhachalam and other places are 

noted for their sculptures, particularly for the depiction of the 

hundred and eight dance poses with appropriate verses from the 

Natyashastra inscribed as labels. The decorative pilaster motif, 

which is essentially a pilaster carrying a shrine motif, often a 

nasika front, on top that adorned the recesses of the walls of 

vimana aditalas, mandapas and gopurqs, came to have a purna ghata 

or puma kumbha base, appearing as though the pilaster emerges 

out of a full pot or pitcher of plenty signified by foliage flowing 

out of its mouth. These kumbha panjaras became a common 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 151 





feature. The corbel shapes also change, and the central tenon of 

the simple bevelled corbel of the earlier Chola temples, assumes 

more or less the form of a bell-shaped pendentive, which gradu- 

‘ally becomes floral and extended, anticipating the incipient 

madalai, or curved stalk of the characteristic риѕйра potika of the 

Vijayanagar times and after. The abacüs of the pillar and pilaster 

capitals becomes thinner, smaller, and polygonal in contrast with 

the large, thick and square forms of the Pallava and earlier Chola 

times. The octagonal griva and sikhara of the southern style, which 

were more common in earlier times become from now on the more 

general norm of the southern temples, though the square and 

circular shapes are occasionally, and the apsidal style still more 

rarely, seen. 



Mandapas like the Airavatesvara porch-mandapa in the form of 

a chariot on wheels drawn by horses or elephants or both added 

to the front of the mukha-mandapa, or to one of its sides forming 

the main entrance, became rather common. These are found in the 

Sarangapani and Nagesyara temples in Kumbakonam (Thanjavur 

district) where in the case of the Nagesvara it fronts the sabha- 

mandapa of Nataraja, which again is -another feature added to 

the temples from the later Chola times. They are also to be found 

in Tiruvarur, Kudumiyamalai, Vridhdhachalam, Chidambaram 

and many other places. This provided inspiration to the Eastern 

Ganga king, Narasimha, for constructing such а mandapa in his 

Simhachalam temple in north coastal Andhra, and more so for 

his great Sun temple at Konarak. 



The addition of the Devi temple brought into more common 

vogue the Kalyana utsava, or annual ceremonial marriage festival 

of the god and goddess, for which special Kalyana dolotsava-(swing 

festival) mandapas with attached yaga-mandapas were built. The 

advent of the special Nataraja shrine as part of the sabha-man- 

dapas or nritta-mandapas in Siva temples has already been men- 

tioned earlier. The other types аге the utsava-mandapas for various 

periodical festivals where the utsava murtis were decorated, wor- 

‘shipped and taken out in procession. Snapana- ог abhisheka- 





152 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





mandapas (halls for ceremonial bathing rituals), vyakarana-man- 

dapas (halls for exposition and educational purposes), ranga- and 

.natyasalas for dance and music, and even atura salas (hospital 

.mandapas) came to . be added to ‘the temple complex. All these 

made the medieval temple of the Tamil land the hub not only of 

the religious but also of the social, economic and other temporal 

activities ofi the: community which always centted round the 

temple. 





THE LATER (WESTERN) CHALUKYA-HOYSALA SERIES 





The Rashtrakutas, whose two important temples, the Kailasa 

monolith at Ellora and the Jain temples on the’ outskirts of 

Patadkal, have been considered earlier, were replaced in the 

Deccan by the resurgent Western Chalukyas of Kalyana who 

became the most important power between the eleventh and the 

thirteenth centuries. They continued the Chalukya-Rashtrakuta 

traditions with a gradual introduction of significant modifications 

of their own. Their earlier temples such as the Navalinga group 

and the Kallesvara at Kukkanur near Gadag (Dharwar district), 

assignable to the latter half of the tenth century, are perhaps the 

last among structures that were built of sandstone, and mark the 

end of the sandstone-trap rock tradition. They adopted different 

soft stones, such as the chloritic schist, for their temples during the 

middle of their period. 



The fine cluster of nine temples ina group called the Navalinga 

temple consists of nine two- or three-storeyed square vimanas, 

single-walled, and built round the sides and ends of a linear row 

ofthree mandapas, all of poor quality, sandstone. In general 

appearance, but for the characteristic sukanasikas, they resemble 

the Biccavolu temples of the Eastern Chalukyas. The top talas are 

devoid of the Aara, the top sikhara has a prominently splayed out 

brim or lip, and the sides arc offset repeatedly. The kudus still 

retain their arched shapes. The hara elements too retain their 





STRUCTURAL STONE.TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 153 





«characteristic shapes, and the projected bays of the aditala wall . 

have devakoshtha niches framed by kuta fronts mounted on shorter 

pilaster pairs, or by makara toranas. The door lintels too are 

elaborate makara toranas, often with a Gajalakshmi crest as the 

lalata bimba. The mandapa pillars are partially lathe-turned in 

respect of their capitals, while the shaft is square and angular, 

marking the beginnings of the characteristic and almost wholly 

lathe-turned pillars of the later periods. Standing a little away from 



. the group is the Mahamayi temple with an oblong shrine appro- 

priate to Devi Vimanas, and two front mandapas, also oblong. An- 

other obloug shrine with narrow front mandapa stands next to the 

Navalinga cluster. It has a tank at one corner. The other ruined 

structures are all enclosed by a prakara with two openings on two 

‘of the four sides. The mention of goddesses like Ganga, Kalika, 

Sarasvati and Mahamayi in the associated inscriptions indicates - 

a strong Devi cult in this centre. 





The Kallesvara.has a square three-storeyed nirandhara vimana 

fronted by an antarala and a closed mandapa in the axial line over 

which also the hara of the aditala level is extended. The top tala 

is bereft of the hara, a sukanasika projects from the upper tala 

over the antarala. The storeys, however, are not boldly marked off 

as in the earlier type, and the square sikhara with offset sides has 

a well splayed out brim. The kudus on the cornices are beginning 

to lose their horse-shoe shape and have become flat facets or ante- 

fixes. The wall spaces between the relieved bays of the adifala are 

adorned by reliefs of shrine frontals with superstructures of the 

southern vimana patterns, or of the northern prasada patterns. The 

square-based pillars of the mandapa are partially fathe-turned, 

particularly the capitals below the phalaka, showing some advance 

in this respect over the earlier Navalinga examples. There are two 

rectangular shrines facing the four central pillars of the mandapa, 

perhaps originally dedicated to Ganapati and Durga. The recesses 

of the mandapa wall have perforated windows. But what is more 

interesting from the constructional point of view is the fact that 

the walls, though of usual thickness, are built of smaller blocks of 





154 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





stone, a tendency to approximate to brickwork, in contrast to the 

large-sized blocks used in the earlier cyclopean or near cyclopean 

constructions of the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas. 



Turning to the temples of Lakkundi, also near Gadag, one comes. 

across temples in the construction of which sandstone, till then 

usual, is totally abandoned in favour of a fine-textured, soft, 

chloritic schist stone that is quarried naturally in lesser thicknesses. 

The new material, because of its less thick quarry size and the 

greater ease with whick it can be cut, naturally reacted upon 

workmanship, resulting in the reduced size of the masonry courses 

and increased volume of fine and delicate carvings on such tempt- 

ing soft and smooth material. Of the many interesting temples of 

such material in this place, the Jain temple is the largest and most 

prominent which might have: been built in the latter half of the 

eleventh century. It has a square five-storeyed nirandhara vimana, 

with a square griva and sikhara. It had originally a closed nava- 

ranga-mandapa in front, though an open mandapa was added later 

on. The central bay of the mavaranga included within the four 

central pillars is a square larger than the eight surrounding peri- 

pheral bays. The single aditala wall is made thick and massive to 

carry the hara and the functional tala with a shrine over it (as in 

the Jain temple at Pattadkal which, however, is sandhara) and is 

also provided externally on its sides, with repeatedly offset projec- 

tions. In addition, it has four supporting pillars at the four inner 

corners of the garbha-griha. The aditala hara is extended as usual 

over the antarala and the larger navaranga. The upper talas, of a 

considerably lesser height and a gradually diminishing width, have 

the hara over them, except the topmost one. The griva tóo is very 

short and the prominent squattish sikhara has a well splayed out 

brim. The kudus on the cornice, though flat, retain their arched 

shape, and have simha mukha finials. The pilasters on the walls are 

slender with capitals that have lost their robust shapes. The pro- 

portionate sizes of their components are lost and the abacus, or 

phalaka, is small and thin. In the spaces between the paired pilas- 

ters on the walls are inset 'nasika front motifs. In the recesses 





‘STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES — THE MIDDLE PHASE 155 





_ between the bays of the wall occurs the ‘decorative pilaster'—a 

pilaster carrying a shrine front or pavilion on top, as is to be found 

in the Chola temples of the eleventh century at Thanjavur and 

Gangaikondacholapuram. The decorative pilaster is framed in-- 

side a torana over two shorter pilaster supports. The tall functional 

second tala and the five-storeyed elevation lend stature to this fine 

vimana.- 



The Kasi-Visvesvara temple at Lakkundi, and the Mahadeva 

temple at Ittagi, also not far from Gadag, mark among others the 

zenith of architecture and art jn this area under the Western 

Chalukyas. The date of the latter temple is precisely indicated by 

its inscription as A.D. 1112. The main vimana, extant only up to 

the griva, the sikhara and stupi having been lost, is a square five- 

storeyed structure standing on an elaborately moulded adhishihana 

with a sukanasika projected from the level of the fourth tala over 

the antarala roof. The entire vimana on each side is thrown out 

into five prominent bays, the central one being the most projected, 

with four narrower recesses in between, the bays again offset 

repeatedly, so that the plan is apparently a scalloped one. The hara 

on each side of the-falas in correspondence with the width of the 

bays are made of two karnakuras, one at either end, a central sala, 

and two intervening panjaras. The most projected central bay of 

each side of the aditala with sala superstructure embraces deep 

and broad niches forming miniature sanctums, making the whole 

appear like lesser vimanas, with their pillars, prastara and super- 

structure clustering round the base of the central one, while the 

corner ones, corresponding to the karnakutas, have narrower and 

shallower fronts. The navaranga forms a larger square in front, its 

outer walls and adhishthana similarly relieved and recessed. and 

with similar external ornamentation. What is more interesting is 

its highly ornate and raised central ceiling, and the fine carvings on 

its tier slabs, particularly those cutting the corners of the ceiling of 

square bays. This mandapa:is provided with three entrances, east, 

south and north, with pillared porches, the front one connecting it 

with an open multi-pillared agra-mandapa axially in front, which: 





.156 TEMPLES OP SOUTH INDIA 





again has three porches on its three sides. The excessive decorative 

elements of this temple, ás.also the plan and other "features, ' 

indicate its proximity in time to the typical temples of the Hoy- 

salas and Kakatiyas who came after them to power in this region 

3n the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. 



The temples built by or under the patronage of the Hoysalas in 

south Deccan and Mysore are of the very tractable, dense and 

fine-grained, soft chloritic schist or talc which permits fine and 

minute carving. The temple unit in general consists of a vimana 

connected by its short antarala to a closed navaranga which may 

often be preceded by another mandapa. It is not also unusual for 

the temple unit to have three, main vimanas on three sides of a 

common navaranga each opening into it by the connecting antaralas, 

the fourth side of the navaranga being provided with the main 

entrance, or porch. This is termed trikutachala. The whole com- 

plex is raised over a common wider terrace, or upa-pitha, providing 

an open circumambulatory round the entire unit over its top 

platform. By the repeated offsetting not only of the sides but 

alio of the angles, the resulting plan becomes star-shaped, the 

same plan as would result by rotating a square pivoted at its 

centre so that its corners, or the ends of its diagonals, touch 

sixteen or thirty-two or more points on a circle circumscribed _ 

round it. This star-shaped external configuration is made to 

extend from the upa-pitha to the apex of the vimana superstructure. 

This, incidentally, provided a larger surface area for the execution 

of the cloyingly prolific sculpture and carving for which the Hoy- 

sala temples are noted. The adhishthana pattern is more akin to - 

the northern style in having tiers of superposed friezes of ele- 

phants, warriors, horses, hamsas, makaras, etc., the broad pattika- 

like top tier depicting Puranic scenes in a series of narrative 

vignettes. The walls are embellished by niches crowned by pyramid- 

al tiered superstructures and enshrining figure sculpture of varied 

iconography. The intervening parts are adorned further. by pilasters 

carrying pyramidal tiered superstructural motifs on top. The pras- 

tara has a prominent eaves-like cornice. The superstructure is a 





- STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 157 





scheme of close-set hara elements, essentially of kutas, rising one 

behind the other, each marking a stercy, the topmost one carrying 

a short griva and octagonal sikhara terminating in a sfupi. The 

middle of the front face of the upper talas is drawn forward into а: ` 

sukanasika over the antarala below. The pillars inside the man- 

dapa have square bases. The shaft and capital region up to the 

broad square abacus is smoothly rounded, turned on a lathe and 

polished, forming a series of bulges and curved necks, beadings, 

etc., usually later embellished by finely picked ornamentation. 

Often the axial series of the temple unit is surrounded by an open 

court and pillared cloister inside the prakara wall, having its maha- 

dvara entrance only on. one side, the front. í $ 



Among the hundreds of Hoysala temples of greater or lesser 

merit, the most well known and typical аге: the Hoysalesvara 

among the many temples at Halebid, the Chennakesava temple 

at Belur (both in Hassan district; the two towns were the earlier 

and later capitals of the Hoysalas), and the Kesava temple at 

Somnathpur (Mysore district). 8 



The Chennakesava temple unit at Belur was built by Hoysala 

Vishnuvardhana in 1117 and consecratgd to Vishnu with the name 

Vijaya Narayana. It now forms the р cipal unit in a complex of 

later temples, surrounded by a cloister and prakara, with a gopura 

entrance in the east on the axial line of the main unit, and a plain 

side entrance to its south on the same, side. The present brick- 

work superstructure of the gopura is а much later renovation. As 

designed and completed by Vishnuvardhana it had the vimana of a 

beautiful stellate plan and an ornate ;sanctum doorway with a 

superbly carved over-door, and an antarala fronted by a similar 

ornamental doorway. The ornamental doorway was preceded by a 

large navaranga, the three sides of which had extended passages or 

closed porches, east, south and north, terminating externally into 

elaborately carved entrances with over-doors. The whole is raised 

on an upa-pitha, 1.5m high, the plan of its open circumambnlatory 

following the stellate plan of the vimana and. its axial mandapas, 

In front of the three external openings of the ‘mandapa are two 





158 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





short flights of steps down the adhishthana and upa-pitha heights, 

respectively, with two miniature vimana models posed at either end 

on the ground level and on top ofthe flight of steps over the upa- 

pitha platform. The bases of the peripheral pillars of the navaranga 

and its three porches were interconnected by kakshasana platforms 

over which a few generations later (in the time of Ballala II who 

built the tank at the north-east corner and the prakara), perforated 

screen walls were fitted between the pillars, making the mandapa 

a closed one: The adhishthana tiers of the vimana antarala and 

mandapa are profusely carved with long lines of friezes of animals, 

men and narrative scenes. The walls carry sculptures of icono- 

graphic interest. The relieved bays on е, three sides of the vimana 

aditala, which are almost buttressing miniature vimanas, have deep 

cells inside for sculptures of deities. The overhanging kapota of the 

mandapa is supported by numerous finely-carved female figures in 

graceful poses called madanikas. The superstructure of the main 

vimana is now lost. The pillars inside the mandapa are exquisitely 

lathe-turned or intricately carved, and a few of them carry fine 

bold figure sculptures. The raised coffer-like central ceiling of the 

mandapa, rising in eight tiers by stepped-up triangular slabs cutting 

the corners successively, forms a sort of octagonal hollow dome 

“with all the tiers intricately carved. The apical covering stone 

extends down the centre as a large, intricately-carved lantern-iike 

pendentive or karnika. The lowest tier of the ceiling is also sup- 

ported, as it were, by madanikas, more beautiful than those outside, 

sprung from the square abacus ofthe lathe-turned pillars. The 

temple thus is a veritable museum of sculptures, large and small, 





and intricate vegetal, floral and animal carvings. 

The Hoysalesvara, built about 1150, among the many other tem- 





ples of the period in Halebid, is a composite of two similar vimana 

units, both dedicated to Siva, standing side by side on a common 

raised platform, a combination of two stellate upa-pithas. Each 

unit consists of a vimana of a star-shaped plan with antarala and 

navaranga in front, facing east. Each navaranga has three projected 

entrances in a cruciform manner with the northern arm of the 





- 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 159 





southern navaranga joined to the southern arm of the northern 

-navaranga resulting in а common passage between the two. The 

adhishthanas of both the units are made up of elaborate animal or 

narrative friezes forming their respective tiers. Externally the inter- 

columnal spaces of the projected porches are screened by perfora- 

ted windows above the level of the kakshasana platforms that join 

together the bases of the pillars. The walls of the vimana, the inter- 

connecting transept, and the walls of the mandipas are covered 

externally with large sculptural reliefs of remarkable fineness. The 

-entrances of the porches, the antarala and the shrine ch#mber are 

framed by elaborately carved over-doors, with elegant makara 

torana lintels on top. The superstructures of both the vimanas are 

lost. The upa-pitha platform provides a broad open circumambula- 

tory round both the units. Standing in front of the temple units, 

and at some distance from them are two open-pillared Nandi-man- 

dapas, both asymmetrical and later additions, though of the same 

period, the southern onc having a small shrine at its rear. Though 

incomplete as it stands now, the Hoysalesvara marks the climax of 

Hoysala art and architecture. 



The Kesava temple at Somnathpur is a fine example of one of 

the latest in the series of Hoysala creations. It was built in 1268 

by Somanatha, a general of the Hoysala king. ft is one of the 

most exquisitely carved temples of small size, resembling a jewel: 

casket. It is a trikuta temple with three principal vimanas of equal ` 

magnitude, facing north, east and south, respectively, opening into 

a larger and closed common mandapa on its north, west and south 

sides. To its east is added a larger nararanga-mandapa closed by per- 

forated screen walls over the kakshasana level. All the three shrines 

are dedicated to Vishnu in different forms. The whole is mounted 



. overan.rpa-piha platform of steller plan, as also are the three 

-yimanas and Ње mandapas from base to apex. The platform provides 

a broad circumampbulatory. This axial series is surrounded by an 

"open court with 4 peripheral cloister of sixty-four shrines inside the 

prakara wall. The shrines аге ranged on the rear half of the cloister 

close to the prekara; while the anterior half forms a continuous

incidents from the Ramayana and the -Bhagavata. The wall niches. 

have boldly moulded figure scutptures of gods and goddesses. The: 

pillars inside the mandapa are all finely lathe-turned with gracefully 

carved mouldings. More ‘interesting, however, are the coffered 

ceilings óf the navaranga, as also those of the inner mandapa, and 

the outer porch, looking like inverted basketry, with elaborate car- 

-vings, floral, vegetal, serpentine, etc. of different patterns and 

including small sculptures of dikpalas, no two ceiling bays looking 

alike. The larger central bay is the most significantly wrought bay. 

Of the temples of the Kakatiyas of Orangallu, or Warangal, the 

temples at Hanamkonda and Palampet are the most well known, 

and typical of their architecture and art. The so-called “thousand- 

 pillared temple’ at Hanamkonda (Warangal district), built by King 

Prataparudra in 1162, shows well the transition from the late 

Western Chalukyan to the Kakatiya style. The main part consists 

of a trikuta or triple shrine of considerable dimensions and dedica- 

ted to Siva, Vishnu and Surya, all the three opening into a common 

mandapa on its west, north and east, respectively, and the whole 

standing over a common platform. The mandapa has open corners 

between the three shrines and on its two sides, and its pillars inside 

are lathe-turned. The adhishthana, the walls with pilasters and the 

prastara are repeatedly offset, with projected bays, the central one 

on each side projecting the most and constituting by itself a small 

side vimana with a cella. The superstructures of all the three 

vimanas are lost. The most interesting part extant is the multi- 

pillared mandapa with about three hundred pillars, all richly car- 

ved. This is attached in front of the unit to an intervening Nandi- 

mandapa. Another interesting feature of this ruined temple within 

the fort is ‘the elaborate free-standing zoranas marking the 

entrances. 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 161 





The temples at Palampet (Warangal, district) form another in- 

teresting group. The main temple of'the group constructed in 1215 

stands on a high platform, with a Nandi-mandapa in front. It is 

enclosed by a massive wall. The main vimana, essentially square 

on plan, has its three sides offset prominently into five bays each, 

the central one of each side further offset forward and constitüting 

a three-tiered replica of the main vimana on a lesser scale. The 

other bays. have tall close-set pairs of pilasters carrying on their 

tops shrine-motifs which are replicas of the superstructures of the 

. southern-type vimanas and northern-type prasadas alternately. The | 



haras of the talas are indistinct, with more of the kuta element con- - 

spicuous. The griva too is abbreviated and less distinct and almost 

of the same. width as the domical sikhara. The entire, superstruc- 

ture is of brickwork. Axially, a closed square antarala or ardha- 

mandapa connects the vimana with a large navaranga in front, 

which is surrounded by a peripheral platform with an outer series 

of thirty-two pillars and a circumambulatory. The most noteworthy 

feature is the array of brackets in the form of female figures, 

rising from the capitals of the pillars and strutting up the beams 

and the cornice. Twelve of these are almost life-size figures of 

slender build and in graceful poses. The rest are rearing vyalas, 

their hind legs resting on elephant heads. The bases of the periphe- 

ral pillars of the mandapa are also connected by a -vedi and a balus- 

"trade forming the lean-back of the kakshasana. The interior of the 

mandapa is*also full of sculptures; and the ceilings of the bays are 

. ornate. The hara of the aditala of the vimana is also extended over 

- the mandapa terrace. On the platform inside are a set of eight sub- 

shrines in four pairs adjacent to each of the four corners of the 

navaranga. While the main structure is of reddish sandstone, the 

decorations are of polished basalt or hornblende, which are stones 

of the hard variety. Ye 

Among the three temples in Pillalamarri (Nalgonda district), the 

Erakesvara, now called Somesvara, consecrated in 1208, is like the 

great temple of Palampet, a complete unit of the Kakatiya pattern. 

It consists of a vimana with a mukha-mandapa in front that is 





162 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





provided with three projected porch entrances, preceded by flights 

ofsteps on the north, east and south, while the garbha-griha is 

attached to the west with a connecting antarala. The whole stands 

on a prominent and well-moulded upa-pitha. The wall,of the garbha- 

griha over the adhishthana on each face has five prominently re- 

lieved pilasters, the central one wider than the lateral pairs, and 

the prastara on top has a slopy flat plain cornice. The recesses bet- 

ween the pilasters contain the usual short and slender pilaster 

motif surmounted by a shrine superstructure over its abacus. The 

superstructure of the main vimana, now ruined, appears to have 

been of four talas or storeys with a prominently projected sukana- 

sika on the front side over the antarala, a Nandi placed on top of 

it. The sikara оп top also appears to have been square. The 

mandapa with offset sides has four carved pillars at its centre 

round a raised floor vith a ceiling, which is a grid of nine squares, 

each containing a lotus. 



The Namesvara temple in another part of the village, consecra- 

ted in about 1202 by Nami Reddi, is a more elegant structure with 

carving and sculpture richer than in the larger Erakesvara. It con- 

sists of the vimana facing east and open mukha-mandapa connected 

by an antarala. The upa-pitha is absent. The mukha-mandapa has 2 

frontal porch. .The mandapa is of the navaranga pattern with four 

central pillazs round the centre of the floor and twelve more pillars 

on the periphery. Adjacent to the Namesvera is a triple-shrined 

unit with three shrines opening on the south, west and north of a 

common mukha-mandapa. The three shrines, all alike, are compara- 

tively plain structures built of large slabs of stone with no decora- 

tions on their exterior. The shrines named Namesvara, Kamesvara 

and Kachesvara (now called Mukkanti Siva temple) were built by 

' Nami Reddi at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The ruined 

brickwork superstructure has lost many of its distinctive features. 



The temple complex at Ghanapur (Warangal district) inside the 

mud-fort at the centre of the village is another example of a Kaka- 

tiya temple complex. The nuclear structure dedicated to Siva is 

large with a mandapa in front and a number of lesser independent

shrines of varied shapes on the four sides, some of them with man- 

dapas and others without such an axial appendage. The main 

structure is like the great temple of Palampet in size, plan and ele- 

vation. It faces east. The vimana of 16.3m width at base is 

connected to the western side of a large mukha-mandapa through 

an antarala, the mukha-mandapa having openings with entrance 

porches on the other three sides, east, south, and north. The whole 

stands on a double plinth, as usual, the wider upa-pitha platform 

below and the adhishthana, or the real base of the structures above, 

leaving an open ambulatory all round. The superstructure of the 

vimana is unfortunately lost. Over the adhishthana of the mandapa 

there is the usual dwarf wall, or vedi parapet forming kakshasanas 

and supporting the shorter peripheral pillars at the corners and on 

either side of each porch entrance. These pillars, as at Palampet, 

carry fine caryatid brackets springing from the top cubical part of 

the shaft and reaching up to the corbel and cornice. The bracket- 

figures represent madanikas in graceful poses, and vyalas surmount- 

ing elephants, each with a human torso emerging out of its gape. 

The walls of the antarala and sanctum are alternately relieved by 

flat pilasters and recessed, as in other temples of the type, the 

recesses containing a pilaster motif crowned by a shrine superstruc- 

ture below а pafra-lata arch or torana, the common motif of the 

Kakatiya temples. The bases of the main pilasters have relief. 

sculptures of gods and dancers. Inside the mandapa there are minor 

shrines arranged on the periphery, five.of them extant, as in the 

Palampet temple again. The roof of the mandapa is lost. Axially 

there is a ruined mandapa in front of the eastern porch. The sur- 

rounding parivara shrines are of varied character, with or without. 

a front mandapa. Some of them have tiered superstructures still 

extant with sukanasika projections, in some of which the kuta sala 

elements of the southern vimana are evident. Many of them have 

square sikharas. In one case at least the crowning part is of the 

amalaka type. 

There are about a dozen temples, not very outstanding, inside 

the Warangal Fort, many of them only small structures like the 





164 “TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Virabhadra, Mandalamma, Rama, Visbnu, Venkatesa, Svayambhu, 



Nelasambhu, Jangamesvara, and Devi temples. The two small 



temples at Katachpur (Katakshapura) in the same district are 

- trikuta with their superstructures lost. : 



The Kakatiya temples, though they derive mostly from the Wes- 

tern Chalukyan group, form a distinct category. They include single 

vimana units and trikuta units. The superstructure over the stone- 

built body in many cases, especially the larger temples, is of brick 

and mortar. The trikuta units are to be found among those at 

Panagal. The Rudresvara-Vasudeva-Surya complex at Hanam- 

konda is the best example of this type. One of the units is at 

Pillalamarri. This and the shrine to the west of the main temple at 

Palampet are also trikuta. The single vimana units, of which a 

typical example is the great temple at Palampet, show variations 

in plan, rise, and decorative, details. Typically the vimana is con- 

nected by an antarala to a frontal mandapa with three porch én- 

trances on the three other sides. The mandapa, after the navaranga 

pattern, has four central pillars, which are highly finished and are 

decorative, lathe-turned, with basal and top cubical sections on 

the shaft, with their faces sculptured, and an intervening polygon- 

al belt. The jar-like kalasas or lasunas, with more straight sides 

than curved, are polygonal in section often and the kumbha is 

flattened in the form of a circular and lenticular disc with almost 

a sharp or narrow edge. The phalaka is large, square and thin in 

section. All this indicates an elaboration of the trends already 

noticed in the. Western Chalukyan temples. The pillars in the 

mandapa of the great temple at Palampet and in the triple shrine 

of Hanamkonda are of black granite, lathe-turned and highly 

polished, while in the other cases they are of sandstone. Similar 

shorter peripheral pillars. over the vedi of the mandapas, as at 

Ghanapur and Palampet, often carry remarkable bracket-figures, 

of madanikas or of mythical animals. The sanctum and axial 



. mandapa or mandapas are often raised on their own adhishthana 

over a common and larger upa-pitha affording a circumambulatory 

platform round the entire structure and providing the first landing 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE MIDDLE PHASE 165 





over the flights of steps from the ground level to the porch en- 

trances over the adhishthana above. The scheme of vimana, antarala 

and mandapa with three porch entrances is found in the great 

temple at Palampet as also in the one at Ghanapur, the Reddigudi 

and some other shrines in the same place, the ruined temple on 

the tank-bund at Palampet, and the Erakesvara of Pillalamarri. 

The scheme where the mandapa preceding the sanctum and antarala 

has a single porch is to be found in:the Namesvara of Pillalamarri, 

in a lesser shrine at Ghanapur and in Shrine IV at Palampet. 

There are others with a sanctum and an antarala alone, as found 

among the lesser shrines at Ghanapur and Palampet. In a few 

cases, the antarala is absent. The shrine comes directly behind -the 

mandapa and hence the sanctum alone is present. The walls of the 

garbha-griha:are sometimes plain in the simpler . cases as in the 

one on the tank-bund at Palampet. The offsetting of the sides is 

not generally much pronounced. When alternately projected and 

recessed, the bays are broad, flat pilaster patterns, often with 

shrine-motifs at their bases. The recesses contain a slender pilaster 

carrying a shrine top at its apex over its abacus with a superposed 

creeper or patra-lata torana over it. The kapota of the prastara is 

not curved in section as it is in the earlier examples of the Pallavas 

and the Chalukyas. It is rather a slopy, straight, “projected ledge, 

often large. The prastara over the antarala and the front mandapas 

carry, like the lower tala of the vimana superstructure, а hara of 

miniature shrines of the kuta variety, often. in brick and mortar. 

These form the fore-runners of the typical arched niche-like minia- 

ture shrine series, the chunchus of the subsequent Vijayanagar 

mandapa prastaras. The sukanasika, projected in front of the viniana 

superstructure is an invariable characteristic, marking the "Chaluk- 

yan derivation of the temples. The antarala and sanctum entrances 

are framed by over-door patterns, which incorporate, in the com- 

position of the sakhas, a vertical perforated jalaka window-pattern. 

The lintel has a lalata bimba of Gajalakshmi or other gods, often 

inthe central loop of a wavy forana issuing from такага heads 

perched atop the door-jambs, The prastara over the door-frame, 





166 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





as in the earlier Chalukyan models, carries a series of miniature 

shrine tops. Thé relieved pilasters on the projected bays of the 

shrine walls have often shallow devakoshthas inside paired pilasters 

with prastara and shrine superstructures on top, single or in: a 

row. In the extreme cases of the larger vimanas, the central bay is 

the most projected one with its devakoshtha niche and superstruc- 

ture simulating a side vimana attached to the main structure. 

These miniature shrine tops here and elsewhere are of the vimana 

type with a square or circular sikhara or of the prasada type with 

an amalaka on top. Another characteristic decorative motif seen is 

a cruciform rosette, or a lotus with four petals spread crosswise, a j 

pattern that one finds carried over to the Ikkeri area of the late 

Vijayanagar Empire and the temples of the Keladi Nayakas there. 



"There are nearly fifty temples of the Kakatiyas known, but they 

are mostly in various stages of ruination. A few of these temples, 

however, are of the Kadamba-Chalukya vimana pattern which have 

been dealt with separately. 





CHAPTER VIII 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES— 

THE LAST PHASE 





THE VIJAYANAGAR TEMPLES 





AFTER THE early Muslim inroads into the south which had abated 

the hitherto continuous temple-building activity, there was appa- 

rently a temporary lull for less than half а century. The rise of the 

militant Vijayanagar Empire to halt the Muslim conquest in the 

middle of the fourteenth century (which, in the process, soon en- 

compassed the whole of the peninsula) almost gave a new and vigor- 

ous spurt to temple architecture by way of repairs or additions 

to existing structures, and erection of new ones. In their northern 

domain the imperial rulers, with their capital at Vijayanagar or 

Hampi, inherited the architectural traditions as carried down till 

their times by the later Chalukyas, Kakatiyas and Hoysalas, and 

in their southern provinces the tradition as developed up to the 

times of the later Pandyas. Thus their temples in their northern 

domains in the Deccan, Andhra and Karnataka regions retain much 

that was of Chalukyan-Hoysala-Kakatiya inspiration, while their 

more southern constructions in Tamil Nadu and southern Kerala 

continued the traits of the Pallava-Chola-Pandya architecture. But 

as already stated, they made one significant change in so far as the 

northern regions were concerned: in all the places throughout their 

vast empire they adopted and spread the hard stone tradition and 

technique of building to the exclusion of the hitherto prevalent soft 

stone constructions. In their vast capital of Hampi, now ruined, 

there are scores of temples, all of hard stone, exhibiting the traits 

from one of the two sources, the Chalukya-Rashtrakuta-Hoysala- 

Kakatiya series, and the Pallava-Chola-Pandya series. Their 





"168 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





subseguent capitals at Penukonda (Anantapur district), Chandragiri 

(Chittoor district), and Vellore (north Arcot), and their environs, 

and their provincial capitals or seats of viceregal Nayakas as at 

Vellore (north Arcot), Gingee (south Arcot), Thanjavur, Madurai, 

‚ and Ikkeri (Shimoga district) also have temples of their period. 

In fact, the reign of the Vijayanagar rulers witnessed a greater 

activity in temple-building than had been the case in the times of 

the Cholas. Some of their temples are remarkable for the great 

size of their componént structures, i.e. the mandapas and gopuras. 

The choice of hard stone, as against the then extant soft stone 

tradition, for the fabric of construction in the building activities, 

including temple architecture and sculpture, in the northern part 

or the home provinces of the Vijayanagar Empire was a significant 

enough step. It marked a definite break and made the designers 

and the architect-sculptors think in terms of the new _ material’ and 

urged them to put forth their best, both in terms of number and 

quality that would reflect the aim and genius of the Vijayanagar 

epoch. It is to be’ noticed that the extensive and many-walled 

fortifications of cyclopean masonry, the massive gates and other 

defence: works of the new capital city,- which now forms the cele- 

brated ‘Hampi Ruins’ centring round the earlier existing temple 

of Sri Virupaksha or Pampapati on the banks of the Tungabhadra 

amidst the chain of massive granite hills, as also the numerous 

temples that sprang up since, inside and outside the city were all 

built of the hard stones quarried from the local hills. This new 

capital was located on' the right bank across the river with the 

old capital Anegundi on the left bank and came to be called 

Vijayanagar,’ or the “City-of Victory” that lent the name also to 

the dynasty. 





1Alternatively it was also called Vidyanagara in honour of the great saint- 

preceptor - Vidyaranya. He was sanyasin of the Sringeri Sankaracharya 

lineage ordained by the great pontiff Vidyasankara also called: Vidyatirtha 

‘and himself became the pontiff as second in succession to him. .During 

Vidyaranya's sojourn in. the Hampi area, as a sanyasin (in the times of 

Vidyasankara as pontiff of the Sringeri Matha) he took both the royal; 

brothers, the founders of the dynasty, Harihara I and Bukka, under his’ 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE LAST PHASE —— 169 





The urgent need for stone constructions in and around the new 

capital and the requirements of the know-how of the technique 

of working on the hard, adamantine stones, in which material the 

rocky terrain of Hampi and the neighbourhood abounded, was 

perhaps met from the further south where the craftsmen were 

for long centuries steeped in the hard stone tradition and 

possibly also from the Kakatiya region in the north, where sculp- 

ture in hard stone had come into vogue for some time, since." 

These should have helped the Vijayanagar craftsmen guilds even 

in their initial achievement which was considerable enough after 

the stagnation that ensued due to the invasions and upheavals. 





fostering spiritual care and as their constant preceptor friend, philosopher 

and guide played a momentous role in the events of the time culminating in 

the foundation of the new Hindu empire of Vijayanagar. Under the aegis 

of the saint, Virupaksha I celebrated his coronation in. the new capital on 

18 April 1336 in the presence of God Virupaksha undertaking to rule the 

kingdom as the agent of the deity in token of which he adopted the royal 

sign manual Sri Virupaksha that continued as such ever since. Placing all 

the royal insignia at the feet of his guru Vidyaranya, in all gratitude and 

reverence, he hailed him as the *Karnataka-simhasana pratishthapanacharya' , 

(the establisher of the throne of Karnataka), a title which the successive 

heads of е: Sringeri Matha have borne till today as also the royal honours 

conferred on the saint at that time by the emperor. This historical back- 

ground will help in the proper appreciation of the, zeal and fervour with 

which the founders of Vijayanagar and their successors entered into the 

tasks of reconstructing the shattered polity and religion of the country, 

repairing the damages wrought to the temples 'and institutions that were 

in existence in addition to consiricting and founding many new ones and ` 

providing for their proper maintenance. E і £ 





2Such migrations or importations of craftsmen guilds from one region to 

another are not unknown. A Mahabalipuram inscription in script of the 

seventh century, cocval with the date of the monolithic rathas, gives a list of a 

team of such artisans—a master architect-builder (Permutachchan) from a 

place (Kevada (?)) a blacksmith (needed to temper the chisels for cutting 

hard stone) or Kollan Semakan by name hailing from Kalyani, ctc. (Sce 

K. R. Srinivasan, The Dharmaraja Ratha and Its Sculptures, New Delhi, 

1975, p. 45). Again “the vastly improved design and execution of the 

Virupaksha temple (Pattadkal) built by one of Vikramaditya II's queens was 

most likely due to workmen brought from Kanchipuram and to their direct 

imitation of the Kailasanatha temple which had come‘into-existence in the 

Pallava capital some decades earlier.” (K.A:N. Sastry, A History of South India, 

Third Edition, Madras, 1966, p. 452). There is inscriptional evidence to show  ' 

that a guild of Dravida (Tamil) artisans had come for work in the Chalukyün ° 

country for the inscription refers to the settlement of affairs relating to - 

the comparative status of the immigrants vis-a-vis the local artisan guilds. 





170 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





The problem of a break or disruption of the continuity of the 

development of the vimana temple in hard stone that had all along 

been the choice and character of the farther south, to which area 

Vijayanagar hegemony soon extended in the reign of Harihara's 

contemporary and successor Bukka, was not so keen in that area. 

In Tamil Nadu and. parts of Kerala that went into the Vijayanagar 

Empire it was merely a task of continuing the then unbroken 

chain of the vimaza temple forms by forging the new Vijayanagar 

links with the modulations and innovations introduced by the 

genius’ of the period as the Vijayanagar idiom. As such tiie evolu- 

‘tionary chain of the southern vimana order could be handed over 

at the end of the empire to the succeeding Nayak rulers for them 

to add in turn before leaving the heritage to be continued in post- 

Nayak times till today. 



- But nearer home, in the northern regions of the empire, the 

break is observed to be more pronounced, conditioned not only 

by the political invasion by iconoclastic rulers of alien faith but 

-also other local and intrinsic causes. The change-over from a 

hitherto soft stones vogue to one of rather quite novel and less 

tractable hard stone, apart, the models left in the hundreds, 

though of great merit as great expositions and landmarks. in the 

history of architecture, by the immediate predecessors, the 

Hoysalas and before them the Western Chalukyas, could not 

supply the want adequately. The very peculiarities of their plan 

and elevation could not afford the starting point for the Vijaya- 

nagar series. Either of. them have become cul-de-sacs, so to say, 

that had taken far away from the main highroad of evolution! 





The very bold emphasis of the vertical off-settings or corrugations from 

pin upwards to thé apex below the crowning elements reminiscent of the 

hadras or ratha projections of the northern Rekha-prasadas against the 

suffused persistence of the horizontal divisions of the superstructure especially 

expounded by the Western Chalukyan genre could not very well offer the 

desired model. For, the emphasis on the horizontal division resulting in the 

tiered nature of the superstructure was the sine-gua-non of the recognised 

southern vimana order. In such a perspective of the subdual, almost to the 

extent of obliteration in effect of the horizontal division and stratification, 

neither could the Hoysala genre satisfy. The similar but stellate vertical 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE LAST PHASE 171 





laid by their precursors, the Rashtrakutas and before them the 

early Chalukyas and codified in the architectural canons. The ` 

early Vijayanagar temple-builders and sculptors had perforce to 

hark back to the earlier developed forms and types obtaining in 

that cradle of temple architecture, viz. the early Chalukyan region, 

that linked the north of India with the south and choose two 

rather basic and characteristically southern strains from among the 

early forms and the welter of their mutations that had since filled 

the landscape developed under the aegis of the succeeding 

dynasties. 



.Of the two types opted, one was the southern vimana form 

with a sukanasa as a type derived from early Chalukya-Rashtra- 

kuta times. The other choice of equal antiquity and ubiquity in 

the area was the Kadamba Nagara, a Kadamba-Chalukya form 

(described in chronological series in the next chapter—IX) with a 

superstructure formed by successively receding tiers, superposed 

one over the other, each tier made up of horizontal or slopy (in 

regions of high rainfall) or curved eaves-like kapota members— 

the smallest topmost tier carrying the griva-sikhara-stupi combina- 

tion. This latter form is akin to what obtains in the pidadeu! 

shrines of Orissan vintage on the north-east and the Phansanakara 

sikhara found in Gujarat and western India on the north-west of 

the Deccan.? The-temples in Hampi and places round about, that 

constitute the maximum agglomeration of Vijayanagar fame, very 





corrugations again extending from the very base to the near apex, more 

boldly emphasized in the Hoysala genre, could not satisfy the need. The 

tempting softness of the stone, coupled with the increased surface area to be 

carved, resulting from the vertical folds or offsets, had encouraged ‘such pro- 

fusions of sculpture. and embellishment, which could not very well be done 

with equal facility in the hard stone material that the Vijayanagar artisans, 

took up for their work. The Hoysala mode both in terms of prodigious output 

and cloying exuberance had almost spent itself out in the effort. 



2The Kadamba-Nagara mannerism in the superstructural tiers culminating. 

in the griva-sikhara-stupi apex, the southern vimana mannerism, was the most 

common combination. The sukanasa may or may not be present and tho: 

jatter form is found adopted in secular constructions, too, as 1n the “Lotus. 

‘Mahal’ in the zanana enclosure in Hampi and in the “Kalyana Mahal’ in tha 

Tower fort of the Rajagiri in Gingee (district south Arcot). 





172 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





patently exhibit this dichotomy, by their conformity with the one 

or the other of these two parent stocks and the most important 

ones of either class are noticed below and in the succeeding 

chapter (IX). 



The Vijayanagar temple-builders could soon catch up with the 

above two opted straius and fall into even strides in the develop- 

ment of the characteristically Vijayanagar temples, many of them 

eventually turning out to be massive and dignified structural 

models of great virtuosity and elevational clarity. But in tbe initial 

years of the nascent empire wherever faced with the challenge of 

raising up imposing edifices, that would accord with the ambition 

and pride of therising empire, the Vijayanagar architects have 

responded by making some bold and daring experiments and 

produced structures that would seem to be aberrant in the geo- 

graphical and cultural context but yet exhibiting merit and fine 

composition. One such example, that is unique in more ways than 

one, will be the Vidyasankara temple in Sringeri (district Kadur- 

Chikmagalur, Karnataka) located high up in the heaviest monsoon 

area of Malnad on the Western Ghats. It was in the Ikkeri 

(Keladi) viceroyalty cf the Vijayanagar Empire—and has been 

one of the principal seats of amnaya mathas founded by Sankara. 

The temple was built under the royal patronage of Harihara and 

Bukka under the behest of their guru, sage Vidyaranya, in com- 

memoration of the earlier and illustrious pontiff Sri Vidyasankara 

also called Vidyatirtha, over the site of his disappearance. The

temple was founded in A.D. 1338 according to traditional accounts 



buta Sringeri inscription indicates the date as 1356. While the 



former date may refer to an earlier nuclear shrine raised on the 



spot, the latter date would indicate that the large all-stone temple 



now standing over the spot was in a completed stage by that 



. year. Thus it would be seen that the temple was founded within a 

few years after the foundation of Vijayanagar, the city and the 

empire. 



The temple.built in the local reddish granite is easily the largest 

among early Vijayanagar temples, consisting of the sanctum and 

axial mandapa combined into one unit. On plan, from foundation 

to the aditala and mandapa prastara, it is a double apse or chapa, 

the two large apses meeting each other by their open ends result- 

ing in an elliptical shape that is rather elongated. The outer curved 

apse ends face east and west respectively. The western half of this 

combination (ellipse) contains the sanctum and as such forms thé 

vimana half while the eastern half contains a large pillared man- 

dapa, there being a narrow north-south transept inside, separating 

the two. The whole stands over an adhishthana raised up in turn 

by an upa- -pitha, both of Ње same plan, elliptical, the lower upa- 

pitha of slightly greater over-all length and width resulting i in the 

formation of a narrow open ambulatory on its top round the base 

of the adhishthana. The provision of an upa-pitha, or sub-base, an 

optional member solely intended to enhance the height and stature 

of the structure according to the texts, bas been an invariable 

feature of the Chalukyan and its lineal cohorts. It follows in its 

ties and mouldings the southern norms including a kapota with 

indistinct kudu ornamentation. The tiers of the adhishthana follow 

the later Chalukyan and Hoysala models in the form and ornate 

nature of its-six projected tiers or mouldings and five recessed 



` sculptured intervals alternating. They, as in Hoysala forms, are 

friezes of horses, elephants, lotuses and on top cameos or panels

in series illustrating episodes from the Puranas and a historical 

narration in sculpture of some local event.. 



The wall above, forms the bahya bhitti or outer wall of the rear 

or western part of the structure surrounding the inner antara bhitti 

that contains the garbha or sanctum thus rendering the vimana a 

sandhara one, while over the eastern part of the structure, it forms 

the external wall enclosing the twelve-pillard ranga-mandapa inside 

it. In imitation of the Western Chalukyan models, the convex 

parts of the front and rear apses are each thrown at intervals into 

seven major vertical off-sets or bhadras which are in turn offset 

further, resembling the sapta ratha mode of the Orissan temples or 

the northern prasadas. These are six doorways set into the six 

major off sets or bays, one each at the forward or eastern end, and 

at the hind or western end, with two more on each flank, south 

and north, the six so arranged that each apsidal half comes to 

have three, one terminal and two lateral. ; 



Each portal or dvara, set inside one of the large bhadra projec- 

tions, is provided with an ornate door-frame having a number of 

sakha components as is the wont with the Chalukyan and its deri- 

vatives and in the northern temples. The lintel has a Gajalakshmi 

relief and the introduction of a wide-set projecting door cornice 

over each one of the doorways is reminiscent of the Kakatiya 

mode. There is the usual river goddess panel at base of each jamb. 

The sill of each door-opening is reached by a flight of seven steps 

over the height of the adhishthana while below there is a corres- 

ponding sopana of six steps over the upa-pitha height, each flanked 

by a pair of elephant balustrades as in -Hoysala examples. The 

eastern doorway forms the principal entrance. 



The bahya bhitti right round exhibits a series of pilasters with 

capitals complete and the interspaces between the pairs of pilasters 

accommodate niches, of the? devakoshtha or torana type. These 

enshrine a galaxy of more than sixty sculptures or sculpture groups 

of varied iconography, making the templesall a veritable museum 

of sculpture and iconography. Titis i is an imitation in the hard stane 

of what the Hoysala predecessors could do in their soft stone

fabric. The sculptures besides being Saiva, Vaishnava and Sakta, 

include the "Buddha and Jina too, rendering the scheme quite 

eclectic. The six doorways are each guarded by a pair of door- 

keepérs, two of the six pairs being Saiva and two more pairs 

Vaishnava dvarapalas, while the remaining two pairs are Sakta 

dvarapalikas as could be identified by the attire and the attributes 

they carry. On top of the wall runs the entablature with the usual 

prastara components but with the difference that the kapota or flex- 

ed cornice or eaves has a double flexure (a doucene or ogee in 

section) instead of the simpler single-flexed kapota encountered in 

all the earlier eras. This is a typical Vijayanagar innovation. What 

is more, its underside is sculptured with a series of curved ribs and 

connecting cross-bars in imitation of the original timber frame of 

pristine kapotas, that was of curved metal sheeting nailed over the 

ribbed frame projected from the tops of the beams to serve as the 

eaves. This delicate imitation is to be seen in the kapotas of 

numierous Vijayanagar structures as for example in the famous 

Kalyana mandapa of the Varadaraja temple in Kanchipuram. An- 

other characteristic Vijayanagar innovation, made as if to display 

the great skills their craftsmen had achieved in working hard 

stones, is the pendent links of stone chains cut out of the same 

corner stone. of the kapota or cornice which is found round the 

eastern corners of this temple. This feat had become ubiquitous 

Jater. 



The inner wall of the rear apse encloses the sanctum or the 

garbha-griha enshrining the principal Vidyasankara linga with a 

narrow aghtarala in front. On either side of the antarala and with 

door-openings facing east in line with that of the antarala are two 

cells, onc on each side. The one on the,south enshrines Ganapati, 

while the other on the north enshrines Durga, as had become the 

form from the Chalukyan times." Attached to the south, west and:

enshrines Brahma with his consort Sarasvati, the one at the rear

the north has Mahesvara or Siva with his consort Uma. Thus the

of five subsidiary shrines bugging close on to the sanctum san. torum. 

The three door-openings in the outer wall of the rear apse, each 

come opposite the three affluent shrines of Brahma, Vishnu and 

Siva on the south, west and north. In front. of the complex the 

front wall of the north-south transept has three openings, the central 

one opposite the antarala and the lateral ones, each opposite the 

Siva, Ganapati and Durga shrines while inside, the transept with 

provision of the openings one at either extreme of its rear west be- 

comes continuous with the circumambulation or pradakshinapatha 

round the whole complex through the sandhara passage between 

the main outer and inner walls. The antaralá front has two dvara- 

palas one of which, curiously enough, is Hanuman while the other 

is sage Bhringi. 



Inside the eastern apse, Or the eastern half of the structure is 

accommodated a large pillared mandapa with twelve peripheral 

pillars each of which is a huge monolith of the composite charac- 

ter that becomes the feature of Vijayanagar temples to come. 

Each pillar has a thick massive central shaft, the front of which is 

carved out, as a huge rearing vyala mounted over a crouching 

elephant, the proboscis of both intertwined, the vyala bearing on 

its head the upper components or corbelled brackets, the topmost 

and most projected being 2 typical pushpa potika as had been. 

evolved out from the late Pandyan types and developed in Vijaya- 

nagar tímes. On the outer face of each such caryatid column is cut 

out the pillai-k-kal or slender columnette attached to the main 

part only by its base and top and having: all the features of a' 

` typical pillar, the potika on top, again, being a pushpa potika. The: 

twelve columns form the outer series of a typical navaranga with 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—IHE LAST PHASE 171 





the four usual central pillars eliminated, Yet the nayaranga design 

is betrayed by the raised ceiling with nine coffered bays on top, 

eight of them surrounding a central larger one. Inside the open gaps 

of each one of the vyalas the stone mass has been very dexterously 

cut out into a round ball which can be rolled inside but not taken 

out, another feat of sculpture by the craftsman as is common in 

the Vijayanagar vyala pillars. The twelve columns are each marked 

by one of the twelve signs of the zodiac or rasi in the regular 

order and are, therefore, called the rasi pillars, the arrangement of 

the pillars being such that the rays of the sun fall on each one of 

them, successively in the order of the twelve solar months. On the 

floor of the mandapa enclosed by the twelve pillars is inscribed a 

large circle with many converging lines to indicate the direction of 

the shadows cast by the pillars when the rays of the sun fall on 

them through one of the three door-openings, north, east and 

south. This is a rare combination of astronomy and architecture. 

The passage outside the ring of the ranga-mandapa pillars and bet- 

ween them and the outer wall has a roof made up of two rising 

stages each with an outward slope while that over the- central 

ranga-mandapa ceiling is raised up still further as a cleresiory. The 

roofing in this highly rain-soaked region is adequately designed by 

the laying above of the long channel stones sloping out and placed 

together, the adjacent parallel edges ofevery two channels being 

covered by an inverted channel stone, hood-like. This pattern is 

found followed in many other temples of this area and the western 

coastal strip on the other side of the Ghats. The large central bay 

on the ceiling of the ranga-mandapa, inside, thus coming to have a 

greater depth—forming as it were a nabhichchanda vitana, bears a 

well-defined inverted lotus blossom with many seriate petals and a 

large pendentive central torus which is pecked by four parrots per- 

ched, topsy-turvy, on the petals immediately surrounding the central 

torus: This is a novel but significant pattern, occupying the central 

vitana in place of the sculptured panel with the icon of the main 

deity consecrated in the sanctum often surrounded by eight dik- 

palas or guardians of the quarters placed all round, as has been 





' 178 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





usual in the earlier series of temples in this “Cbalukyan' area. In 

conjunction with the rasi pillars arrangement, the rasis being the 

‘houses’ which the sun is supposed to aspect in order ofthe 

twelve months, the central lotus is to be identified as symbolic of 

the sun. F i 



The four parrots perched topsy-turvy around the torus of the 

lotus blossom in the ceiling of the rasi-mandapa of the Vidyasan- 

Kara temple, Sringeri, are incidentally the first examples of the 

kind. Their pose is also true to nature, attesting to the acquain- 

tance of the sculptor with things of nature. The ornithologist will 

be reminded of the species of the Indian parrot (Psittacula) com- 

monly called the lorikeet, which is unique among Indian birds for 

its habit of roosting upside down like a bat. To the ascetic yogi, it 

will be a form of sadhana or penance (tapas). 



The superstructure of the vimana or garbha part is an upward 

continuation of the inner wall or antara bhitti. It is a tall cylindri- 

cal tower of three upper talas of gradually diminishing circumfe- 

rence raised over the sanctum terminating in the griva that carries 

the sikhara with the stupi on top, while the roof over the antarala 

‘carries a large sukanasa projected from the front of the vimana 

superstructure. Jt is thus а chatushtala vimana with a sandhara 

aditala. The top of the sandhara passage between the outer and 

inner walls of the aditala is made up of a system of channel-and- 



. hood stones, as over the mandapa half in front, the long stones 

radiating from the base of the second tala with a proper slope 

giving rise to a slopy alinda. The usual hara scheme characteristic 

of southern vimanas made up of miniature shrine aedicules is total- 

ly eliminated over this part, the second and third talas and over 



.the anterior mandapa top, nor does the pattern of the superstruc- 

ture follow the local Hoysala style. The aditalachadya or roof is 

marked externally by the abbreviated adhishthana mouldings of 

the second tala base, the harmya of which is raised tall with the 

vertically offset Dhadra projections, the corners of the offsets can- 

toned by pilasters of the order as in the case of the tala harmyas 

of the southern vimanas. There are three niches provided in the 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE LAST PHASE 179 . 





main bhadras of the three cardinals, south, west, and north while 

on the east comes the prominent sukanasa. The prastara of this 

second fala harmya or the uparichchadya is composed of seven tiers 

of curved cornices or kapotas. The third tala of slightly lesser 

elevation repeats the same pattern ending with its uparichchadya 

of five kapotas, superposed one over the other. The fourth tala of 

still lesser height, again of the same pattern, carries an uparich- 

chadya of the three kapotas. This scheme is an adaptation of the 

system of uparichchadya coming successively over the main tala- 

chchadya, with a clear but short or indistinct recessed neck inter- 

vening between any two, as obtains in the temples of the Eastern 





Ganga and Kalinga vintage but is a modification of the same 

with the respective sets of cornices separated by taller intervals, 





here forming the tala harmyas. The top of the third tala carrying 

the grihapindi or base of the griva has four Nandis at the four 

corners, or vidiks. The circular griva shows a ribbed pattern because 

of the offsetting as in the zalas below and the domical globular 

sikhara, too, exhibits the same pattern of ribbing. The griva 

sikhara combination has four maha nasikas projected on the four 

cardinals, including the eastern face, where.the third tala of the 

vimana rises clear over the top of the frontal sukanasa. The maha 

nasikas are framed in front each by an ornate mukhapatti that 

carries at its apex, a kalasa or stupi that rises up round the base of 

the larger main stupi placed over the crest or mastaka of the 

sikhara proper. All the five stupis are of metal and they together 

form a pancha kalasa scheme, that according to ancient Buddhist 

texts should be the character of a divya vimana. The sukanasa in 

front rises in two stages on top of the antarala, the lower forming 

the rectangular harmya part with a vestibule internally leading to 

the inside of the hollow superstructural falas. This rises to the 

height of the second tala or the harmya over the sanctum. The sala 

type ‘toof or chadya over this vestibule, rising to the height of the 

next vimana tala, is again a system of superposed cornices. The 

sukanasa with its longer side, east-west has a forana mukhapattt 

framing its front that has a framed door-opening leading into thé 





So are 

180 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





vestibule in the lower rectangular face and the sculptured relief of 

dancing Siva inside the arch fronting the upper or roof part of the 

sukanasa, a feature that is common to temples of the Chalukyan 

and northern areas. The vimana superstructure which has a hollow 

interior has its shell of externally carved stone work supported by 

a stone scaffolding built inside made up of upright and cross- 

pieces of roughly hewn stone props and beams, a feature not 

noticed anywhere else in the south. 



Thus this unique temple, which is a bold experiment, as it were, 

in the blending of architectural features, borrowed from far and 

near, and cleverly harmonised, with a unique plan and elevati- 

‘onal lay-out, is an interesting early Vijayanagar production of great 

merit. The intention was to make it a sort of universal amalgam 

of different regional architectural styles with its eclectism in the 

sculpture too, in view of the importance of the spiritual master, 

whom both the royal house and the heads of the spiritual seat 

venerated equally. 



Among the temples in Hampi following by and large the traits 



` of the southern group may be mentioned the Vitthala temple, 

which is one of the largest there. It is, in fact, a great complex 

planned and built at one time, with vimana, axial mandapas, 

garuda-mandapa, other mandapas, including kalyana-mardapas, 

cloister prakara, and gopuras. It was commenced by Krishnadeva 

Raya in 1513 and was perhaps still not completed when the em- 

pire fell in 1565 after which the capital was shifted to Penukonda. 



The mandapas and gopuras are, as in all Vijayanagar temples, 

remarkable for their great size. The mandapas are often of the 

thousand-pillared variety. The pillars and pilasters have elegant 

shafts. The. lower part of the abacus, the pali, which was a plain 

doucene in the Pallava and early Chola temples and got scalloped 

into petals in the later Chola period, evolves still more into a 



floral form with the petals, idal. The corbel evolves into what is 

called the pushpa-potika, characteristic of the Vijayanagar style, 

with a double-flexed arm extending, projected from the main block 

and scalloped at the free end as upturned petals with an incipient 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE LAST PHASE 181 





conical bud at the centre. The downwardly flexed arm has a hori- 

Zontal connective bar below it, Connecting the free tip with the 

main block. The kumbha panjara motif on the wall recesses of 

vimanas, gopuras and mandapas is made more ornate and elaborate. 4 

The cornice, which was till now thick and curved down, becomes 

large, much thin and with a double flexure, and extends far for- . 

ward, often showing the imitation in stone of the wooden ribs of 

the frame-work supporting it. In the case of mandapas, like the 

kalyana-mandapa- of the Varadaraja temple at Kanchipuram, 

one of the finest examples of such kind, the corners of the kapota ' 

bave large stone chains dangling down, all the links, including the 

cornice stone-piece from which it hangs down being cut out of 

one stone. These mandapas, the kalyana- or utsava-mandapas, are 

noted for their fine and intricately-worked colonnades in hard 

stone. Some of the pillars with a series of small columns are cut 

out round the main central shaft, or with large animal sculptures 

or, statues all in a monolithic mode. The aniyottikkals, as they are 

called, are characteristic of the Vijayanagar style. The super- 

structure of the stone vimanas or gopuras are of brick-and-mortar, 

often with timber inside if they are not built in the corbelled or 

kadalika karana fashion. Such immense gopuras were added to the 

outermost prakara of pre-existing temple complexes of importance 

and are called Rayagopurams, sometimes as many as eleven 

storeys high, as in the Ekamranatha at Kanchi, the Arunachala 

at Tiruvannamalai (north Arcot district), and the large Siva 

temple at Kalahasti (Chittoor district), all built by the great 

emperor, Krishnadeva Raya (1502-1529). 



The Vitthala temple complex stands inside а high-walled, paved 

enclosure, with three gopura entrances—east, south and north. 

There are also axial and accessory mandapas and ancillary shrines. 

The axial series consisting of vimanas with front mandapas stands on 

an ornate platform, carved with friezes of men, horses, hamsa, and 

small shrine motifs. The steps leading up to the frontal agra-mandapa 

are flanked by the large stone elephants. The agra-mandapa itself 

contains huge monolithic pillars with carved-out columnettes, or

with Jarge. vyalas. having riders on their backs. The hall һаѕ crnci- 

form extensipns.in front and on the sides. The beams show carvings 

from the Ramayana. "The superstructure of the vimana is of brick- 

work. The hara of the aditala is extended over the tops of the front 

mandapas. In front of the agra-mandapa stands the garuda-mandapa 

which is a lesser vimana fashioned in the form of a temple-car or 

chariot on stone wheels. On the northern side of the fore-court is 

the Amman shrine, while on the south is the beautiful though small 

kalyana-mandapa. There are also shrines for other attendant deities 

in the courtyard. The Krishna temple built by Krishnadeva Raya in 

1513 is another handsome temple complex with the usual compo- 

nents of attendant shrines, the mandapas and pillared. malikas and 

gopura. 



The Pattabhirama temple at Hampi is yet another large temple 

complex of this kind. Built by Achyuta Raya (1530-1542), it is noted 

for its great size and huge proportions. The Achyuta Raya temple 

built in 1539 is another large structure inside a double prakara with 

gopuras and an Amman shrine, mandapas and cloister, designed on 

lines similar to the famous Vitthela temple, though it will not bear 

comparison with that superb creation. Its pillars are, however, 

handsome and it contains some fine sculptures. 



The Anantasayana temple at Anantasayanagudi near Hospet on 

the way to Hampi is an example of a large oblong vimana with the 

brickwork superstructure having an immense sala sikhara. It is 

elaborated axially by a large pillared mandapa, and surrounded by 

other peripheral mandapas and an Amman shrine. The whole is en- 

closed within a prakara with a large gopura. It is the largest sala 

type vimana known. The temple was dedicated to Anantasayin 

Vishnu, but the deity is now missing. The shrine front has three 

doors to render the head, body and feet of the reclining god visible 

from the antarala. у | 



Besides the extension of the hara over the mandapas—a prevailing 

trait of Chalukyan extraction—there are other Chalukyan characters 

retained by some of the other temples in Hampi, and in the Deccan, 

Andhra and north Mysore area. Among them are the presence of

STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE LAST PHASE 183 





the sukanasika in front of the vimana superstructure, the occurrence 

of the sculptures of the river goddess on the door-jambs, and 

ornate over-doors, often delicately carved in soft stone and fitted 

over the plain granite door-frames, as in the temples at Tadpatri 

(Anantapur district). Then there is the navaranga pattern of the 

mandapas, as opposed to the linear multi-pillared type of the farther 

south, and free-standing toranas as in the temples on the top of the 

hill at Chitaldurg (Mysore state). 



The Hazara Rama temple was probably begun earlier and was 





completed by Krishnadeva Raya. This temple is devoid of the 

characteristic gopura but its prakara walls are decorated by friezes, 





externally depicting dance, music and folk festivals. The maha- 

mandapa in front of the main vimana is of the Chalukyan navaranga 

pattern and its four central pillars, in contrast to the greyish granite 





- of the rest of the entire structure, are polished shining black, though 

of square section, and embellished with panels of sculpture and 

carvings. The vimana superstructure of brick has a prominent 

sukanasika. There is an Amman shrine vimana to its north, also of 

the same type. The walls of the open agra-mandapa and of the 

vimanas as also of the prakara on the inner faces around its north- 

east corner have panel sculptures which are narrative, depicting 

episodes from the Ramayana and the Krishna-lilas. 





The Pampapati or Virupaksha temple, the most prominent temple 

in Hampi, and in worship, is a large complex, elaborated round a 





later Chalukyan temple nucleus. Its agra-mandapa of the Vijaya- 

nagar period is noted for its sculptured columns and contemporary 

ceiling paintings. The most interesting painting is a panel depicting 

the sage Vidyaranya, a lineal successor of Sankaracharya and 

pontiff of the Sringeri Matha, being taken in a procession in a palan- 

quin with royal honours and paraphernalia to the Virupaksha temple. 

The hollow, tall, main east gopura, built of brick in the corbelled 

fashion, is one of the largest Vijayanagar gopuras. The Vijayanagar 

Vimanas farther south in Tamil Nadu do not have the sukanasika. 

They conform more to the Pallava-Chola traditions and form a 

continuing link with temples of the earlier epochs. 





184 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 

THE POST-VIJAYANAGAR TEMPLES 





After the fall of the central power following the-disastrous battle 

of Talikotta in 1564 and the ruination of Vijayanagar city, the capi- 

tal ofthe empire was shifted in successsion to Penukonda, Chandra- 

giri and finally to Yellore. The central power was much weakened. 

The Vijayanagar viceroys in the southern regions, the Nayakas, 

gradually assumed independent powers. Some of them fostered 

temple architecture and created some notable temples. They were the 

Nayakas of Vellore (north Arcot district), Gingee (south Arcot 

district), Thanjavur and Madurai id Tamil Nadu, and Ikkeri in 

north-west Mysore. The Nayaka period in Tamil Nadu witnessed 

the addition of elaborate mandapas of the hundred-pillared type, and 

larger gopuras with a greater number of plastic stucco figures on 

them, as at Vellore and Madurai, their tallest gopura superstructure 

being at SriviWiputtur (Ramanathapuram district) in front of the 

Vatapatrasayin temple. The closed ambulatory, flanked on either 

side by-continuous platforms, with massive pillars set on their edges 

on either side of the sunken pradakshina path, and elaborately cor- 

belled brackets on top spanning the gap above and nearly meeting 

each other, built during Nayaka and later times, form the celebrated 

“corridors', as at Ramesvaram. The kalyana-mandapa of the Jala- 

kanthesvara temple at Vellore, and a similar one in the eastern 

prakara of the famous Ranganatha temple at Srirangam, like the 

earlier Vijayanagar structure in the Varadaraja temple at Kanchi, 

are two of the great masterpieces of the time. They are of the 

multi-pillared type, having a facade row of remarkably sculptured 

columns carrying almost full-size monolithic figure sculptures of 

rearing horses with warrior-riders and retinue and other animal 

figures of the hunt. . : 



Most constituents of the large temple complex at Madurai on all 

sides of the nuclear shrine are of Nayaka origin, mostly of the time 

of Tirumalai Nayaka (1623-1659), including the great mandapas and 

towering gopuras ón all the four sides. The huge pillars have life- 

size portraits of royalty with consorts and retinue, or donor-chiefs, 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE LAST PHASE 185 . 





the sculpture so cut out as to form along with the main shaft a 

Common support to the capital. Other sculptures of gods, women in 

graceful poses, tribal folk like the Kurava and-Kuratti—hunter and 

huntress—are also to be found in the composition on the pillars. 

The Pudu Mandapam in the Minakshi-Sundaresvara temple at 

Madurai, and the front mandapa in the temple at Krishnapuram 

are notable examples in this respect among hundreds of others. 



The Subrahmanya temple unit, with vimana ardha- and mukha- 

mandapas standing in the north-west court of the Brihadisvara 

temple complex, is a typical example of the Nayaka temple of the 

ornate variety and a real gem of its kind. Built of fine-grained 

granite, it exhibits in the mouldings of its adhishthana and pilasters 

of its wall some fine and intricate engraving. The characteristic 

kumbha panjara in the wall-recesses between pilasters is rendered 

highly ornate, as also the pushpa potika corbel of the capitals over 

the pillars and polygonal pilasters, with the pendent bud at the tip 

of the curved arm taking the shape of a full lotus bud. The double- 

flexed kapota is thin and elegant, showing the ribbed supporting 

frame-work on its under side. The griya and sikhara of the square 

vimana are hexagonal, in conformity with the six-faced Shanmukha 

form of Subrahmanya installed in the sanctum. The karnakutas 

too of the fala haras of this multi-storeyed vimana are six-sided. 

This and other temples thus formed easily the pattern for the living 

art of the modern stapati or temple-builder of south India. 



Another feature initiated by the Nayakas of Madurai and con- 

tinued thereafter is the employment of polished granite—the ex- 

ternal faces of the plain carved or moulded stones, polished shining 

black, and used in the construction of small vimanas and their 

ardha-mandapas. Such work can be seen in the Rock Fort temple 

at Tiruchirapalli, Madurai, and other places. 



The entire temple complex inside the Vellore Fort including the 

kalvana-mandapa and gopura, as also much of the Virinchipuram 

temple near Vellore, is the work of the Bommi Nayakas of 

Vellore. What we see, however, of temples or their ruins inside the 

extensive fort at Gingee and its neighbourhood is the creation of 





186 ; TEMPLES OF: SOUTH INDIA 





Gingee Nayakas. Similarly, there are many small Nayaka temples 

inside the Chandragiri Fort. 



What: may be reasonably considered to be the quintiscence of 

later Vijayanagar architecture and sculptural art, as evolved in the 

southern half of the Vijayanagar Empire, is the unique example of 

a moderate-sized temple unit, in the large Ranganatha temple 

complex in Srirangam. It may as well be considered to be the pre- 

cursor of, òr the model for, the exquisitely designed and ornately 

carved -Subrahmanya temple unit of Nayaka times, inside the 

enclosure of the Thanjavur Brihadisvara temple complex. On 

tbe basis of an inscription from elsewhere it is believed by some 

scholars, following the epigraphist’s report (A.R.E., 1937), that 

the Vaishnavite teacher of Kuruhurpura who was in charge of 

the Tiru-k-kulal-udina Pillai (Venugopala-Krishna) temple at 

Halebid, that was consecrated by the Hoysala queen Umadevi, 

was during his visit to Srirangam, also, instrumental in consecrat- 

ing a shrine for Venugopala in that temple complex. 



There is a superbly built temple unit of Venugopala extant, with 

exquisite sculptures on its walls and very fine architectural features, 

also with a painted ceiling on its.agra-mandapa (done in Lepakshi 

style). It is located inside the fifth south prakara, west of the 

utsava-mandapam, called locally ranga-mandapam. It is a temple 

unit by itself, facing east with a dvitala vimana that has an aditala 

built of fine grained ‘white granite surmounted by a brickwork 

superstructure, ardha-, maha-and agra-mandapas preceding the 

yimana, in the order. The upa-pitha and adhishthana, are of finely 





carved mouldings adorned by miniature shrine motifs or aedicules, 

at intervals, as in the Darasuram Mandapam. The central bhadra 





reliefs on the walls of the vimana and the mandapas have deva- 

koshthas crowned by sala sikharas, the niches containing lithesome 

sculptures of divine-looking damsels in various poses of suffused ` 

grace and beauty. The recessed wall spaces carry fully formed 

kumbha panjara motifs, in the vimana part, while in similar situa- 

tions on the mandapgs they are elaborately carved vritta sphathitas, 

the so called *decorative pilasters', that is pilasters carrying on top 





STRUCTURAL STONE TEMPLES—THE LAST PHASE 187 





a panjara crest, but devoid of the basal kumbha or purna ghata. 

The pushpa potikas are of the characteristic Vijayanagar type. These 

and the advanced architectural features as also the style of the 

extant paintings on the ceiling of the agra-mandapa or porch would 

only indicate a late Vijayanagar date (bordering on the Nayaka 



times that succeeded). It may perhaps be a Vijayanagar renova- 



tion of an earlier foundation during the Hoysala interregnum and 



not a standing Hoysala example as some scholars aver in the wake 



of the suggestion of the epigraphist. There are a few granite stone- 



built temples of the Hoysala times, built when a collateral branch. 

of the dynasty ruled over parts of Tamil Nadu with capital at 



Kannanur near Srirangam and Jambukesvaram. They are all built 



in the local regional style ‘in logical continuation of the late 



Pandya temples of Tamil Nadu aud consequently heralding features 



of the Vijayanagar temples of Tamil Nadu that followed. 



Such temples of the Hoysala times are to be found in Kannanur 

some 6 kms from Srirangam (Posalesvara, called locally Bhojes- 

vara) and in Jambukesvaram, in the eastern part of the Srirangam 

island. There are a few more, constructed by the Hoysala generals 

and administrators, in the Tiruchirapalli and Pudukkottai districts, 

for example the temple unit at Sembattur (Pudukkottai). These 

temples built during the Hoysala interregnum reveal in their 

architecture and sculpture only the local regional norms, ahd not 

of the Hoysala patterns as known in their home country (Karna- 

taka) built of soft soap-stone. The Srirangam Venugopala temple 

shows noticeably far advanced architectural and sculptural features 

of the local regional style. The sculpture of the tall, slender-built 

graceful maidens, perhaps many of them depicting gopis, besides 

salabhanjikas in different attitudes and poses, contrast with the 

short-built and buxom madanikas, of Belur, Halebid and similar 

feminine sculpture in óther centres of Hoysala art. The Venu- 

gopala temple sculptures, may bear comparison, if one is at all 

required, with the similar hard stone caryatid (madanika) sculp- 

tures of the Kakatiyas and, nearer home, with those at Krishna- 

puram and Tenkasi, (Tirunelveli district) and in the Pudumandapam 





188 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





and other parts of the Madurai-Minakshi-Sundaresvára temple. 

The Ikkeri Nayakas have left temples of a Chalukyan affiliation 

in their capital towns of Ikkeri, Keladi, and in other places in 

their area. The Aghoresvara temple at Ikkeri (Shimoga district) is 

the largest and finest of the Ikkeri style of temples. Built of - 

granite, it stands on a lofty and weli-moulded upa-pitha platform. 

Its five-storeyed square vimana is a Gouble-walled sandhara struc- 

ture, and the fala superstructure has the characteristic sukanasika 

projection. The griva and sikhara are octagonal. The square, closed- 

front mandapa has three projected openings—one frontal and two 

lateral with elaborate over-doors, as is also the case with the 

antarala and shrine-doors inside. They are reached by flights of 

steps with ornaniental balustrades. A horizontal band divides the 

exterior wall face into upper and lower halves. The upper half 

shows a series of pointed arches enclosing lattice-windows with 

. floral spandril decorations and rhomboid rosettes, introducing an 

element of Indo-Islamic motifs. The lower half shows a series of 

shrine-fronts between paired pilasters. Inside, the mandapa is of the 

mavaranga pattern with ornate pillars, some of which have the 

animal statuary characteristic of the Vijayanagar and post-Vijaya- 

nagar pillars. à 

The twin temples of Ramesvara and Virabhadra in nearby 

Keladi, the earlier seat of the dynasty, are built of greyish-green 

granite. The two separate vimanas have their front mandapas inter- 

connected. The Ramesvara was built between 1499 and 1513, and 

the Virabhadra between, 1530 and 1540. Both are sandhara vimanas 

with their walls made up of large slabs laid in longitudinal tiers 

and sparsely carved, as is commonly found in many of the smaller 

temples in Hampi, and in the northern area. The pillars inside the 

mandapa are in the typical Vijayanagar pattern and the ceiling 

slabs are carved with designs and motifs, some of them reminiscent 

of Indo-Islamic designs. 





CHAPTER IX 





OTHER TEMPLE TYPES 





THE KADAMBA-CHALUKYA STYLE TEMPLES 





WHILE THE early Chalukyas took'in the early norms of vimana 

architecture, developed them according to their own regional 

idiom and evolved the early forms of such types, they also devo- 

ted equal attention to the forms more prevalent in the region 

which was earlier dominated by the Kadambas of Banavasi. They 

took note of what was developing further north. Their geographi- 

cal position astride the area of the Deccan, dividing the peninsula 

from the northern half of the sub-continent, made them suscept- 

ible to more influences ' than one. The result was that the cradles 

of early Chalukyan architecture and art, namely, Mahakutesvar, 

Aihole, Pattadkal and Badami, and lower down in Andhra- 

Karnataka region round about Kurnool in Satyavolu and Maha- 

nandi—bordering the castern Chalukyan branch of Vengi—pro- 

duced a mixed varicty of temples—the northern, the southern, and 

those locally known as Kadamba. 

The Kadamba-Chalukya or Kadamba-Nagara type in its sim- 

. plest form has a square vimana body with a low superstructure 

that is a stepped pyramid of successively receding tiers, essentially 

eaves-like or of kapota-like form, often separated from one 

another by short recessed necks standing for the talas. The kapota 

tiers are decorated by relieved Kudu motifs, particularly at the 

centre on cach side. These in their vertical alignment simulate the 

rekha of a northern style prasada sikhara. The separating necks, 

or galas, may be altogether absent or much abbreviated so as not 

to be visible. The tcpmost tier carries a short grira with a distinct 

amalasila, or amalaka, which has a ribbcd globular or lenticular

shape which is the characteristic top member" of: the northern 

prasada superstructure or alternately the griva may carry a sikhara 

with a stupi on as in the southern vimana forms. The former 

resembles the so-called pidadeuls of Orissan architecture or the 

phansanakura edifices of the Gujarat région. In more developed 

forms with.the amalaka crest, the corners of the tiers are further 

provided at intervals with similar smaller amalaka forms, the 

karnamalakas, as in the northern-style temples. It will be evident 

that this system of tiered arrangement of slopy, roof-slabs or 

cornices curved one over the other was best suited to a region of 

high rainfall, as was the original "Kadamba region on the west 

coast.“It witnessed further developments in the area of coastal 

- Konkan and in. the succeeding centuries spread even beyond to 

the east as far as the lower reaches of the Krishna and the Tunga- 

bhadra. The earliest structures in stone, as in some examples in 

Aihole, though possessing the amalaka head and the karnamalakas, 

lack the sukanasika, the invariable characteristic of north Indian 

temple forms. It may be said that this form with either type of 

top member and devoid of or with the sukanasika is more or less 

across between the typical northern prasada superstructure and 

the southern vimana form. This type is exemplified by the Malli- 

karjuna group (с. eighth century) near the Galaganatha.temple at 

Aihole,! the: Lakulisa temple on the way to the Bhutanatha group 

in the Badami valley and in the Mahakutesvar group, all of the 

Badami-Chalukya-Rashtrakuta origin. The group of smaller 

shrines behind the Mahanandisvara temple complex at Maha- 

nandi (Kurnool district), and the Papanasanam group of temples 

in Alampur, are of this type in the Eastern Chalukyan territory. 

Eight of the nine structures of the Lakshmi Devi temple complex 

in Doddagaddavalli (Hassan district, Mysore)? built in 1113 ате

of this type belonging to , the Hoysala period. The Ganigitti Jain 

temple built in 1385, the similar Jain temple on the hill at 

Chippagiri (Bellary district), the group of trikuta shrines on the 

Hemakutam Hill adjoining the Pampapati temple in Hampi, and 

two more just near its gopura as also another a mile north-east 

of Hampi are examples of such types built in the Vijayanagar 

period. It is perhaps because the Ganigitti and Chippagiri temples 

were of Jain dedication that Longhurst chose to call the temples 

on the Hemakutam Hill as Jain too, though they are, from 

evidence found on them, Brahminical.! 



A variant of this form, looking like a cross between the tiered 

talas of the southern vimana and the schematic and undifferenti- 

ated bhumis of the northern prasada, often with amalakas compres- 

sed at the corners, is also to be found distributed over the same 

region in different periods. In this type, each of the bhumis is 

differentiated by simple, short, pilastered and recessed walls that 

divide the entire pyramidal superstructure into square-sectioned 

strata. The top is crowned by a griya, amalasila, and Stupi—as is 

usual in northern prasadas. This is exemplified by the Galaganatha 

at Aihole, with a plain stepped-up superstructure with karna- 

malakas (Temple No. 10 of Cousens). The Mallikarjuna temple 

at Aihole is an example of this kind without the karnamalakas. 





| The other structures standing inside the enclosure of the Maha- 





kutesvara temple complex, except the Makutesvara and the 

Mallikarjuna which are southern vimana type and the Sangames- 

vara Which is cf the northern prasada type, are variants of the 

Chalukya-Kadamba style. Similar temples are to be found at 

Terala near Nagarjunakonda (Guntur district). In the Kadamba 

territory itself, as at Hangal, Belagami, and other places, the type 

assumes aform which has a tiered superstructure of receding 

horizontal slab-like components, a series of upright-lotus bud-

shaped projections or “dentils” along their upper edges in addition 

to kudu-like ornament at the centre, a square vimana-type sikhara 

on top, and a sukanasika in front. This typé became more com- 

mon in the northern territories of the Vijayanagar Empire, as at. 





Hampi. 





THE NORTHERN STYLE PRASADA TEMPLES OF THE 

CHALUKYAS AND THE RASHTRAKUTAS 





The prasada-type structures with square bodies and proportion- 

ately immense curvilinear superstructures quite different in form 

and composition from the superstructure having tiered talas with 

haras of the vimanas were also built by the early Chalukyas in 

Aihole and Pattadkal glong with the other types, as mentioned 

earlier. These also came to be built in other parts of Karnataka 

and Andhra. The sikhara in these temples connotes the entire 

superstructure over the part enclosing the sanctum, forming a 

single unit called the anda, differentiated into nodes defined by 

small gooseberry-shaped karnamalakas at the corners, all com- 

pressed in such a manner that a clear-cut storeyed division, as in 

the talas of a southern vimana, is not revealed. There are only 

undifferentiated bhumis. This sikhara of the rekha-prasada carries 

on top a gala or griva that holds up the large amalaka-shaped 

amalasara or amalasila with a stupi or kalasa finial on its top. 

Thus it would be clear that what is termed as the sikhara in a 

northern rekha-prasada is not to be equated with what is known 

by the same name in the southern tiered vimana. The smaller 

amalakas found. squeezed in at the corners of the superstructure 

of the prasada, hence called karnamalakas, are the only basis for 

differentiating the bhumis. These northern-type prasadas in the 

Karnataka and Andhra region of the peninsula, with their charac- 

teristic Chalukyan idiom, despite their individual variations, form 

a group that stands quite apart ; from such prasada temples of 

western, northern or eastern India. Their adhishthanas generally 

follow the patterns found in the southern vimana, and the body 





OTHER TEMPLE TYPES 193 





is provided with a clear prastara entablature separating the super- 

structural parts over it. The square plan or quadrature is relieved 

by three or five bays on each face from base to top, the relieved 

parts being called rathas, making the temple tri rathe or pancha 

ratha, as the case may be. Tbe most characteristic and con- 

spicuous sukanasika is projected from the front side of the super- 

structure over the antarala roof and is almost as wide as the front 

face of the sikhara at its lowest part and projecting forwards, to 

an extent equal at least to half if not two-thirds the basal width 

of the sikhara in the earlier examples. The axial mandapas are, 

however, of the same pattern as those of the vimana temples of 

the region, and their flat roofs help to make the projected sukara- 

sika more evident than in the northern-style temples elsewhere, 

in which the sukanasikas hardly exceed in width the central bay 

or bhadra projection. Besides the mandapas, these northern-style 

temples of the Chalukyan area share much in common with the 

local vimana types in respect of their pillar forms, door-frames, 

sculptures, particularly dvarapalas on either side of the entrances, 

iconography and other features of embellishment. 



The Huchchimalligudi, the Huchchappayyagudi, and the 

Tarappagudi in Aihole, the Siddhanakolla near it, the Mallikar- 

juna in Mahakutesvara, and the Kadasiddhesvara, the Jambulinga, 

the Papanatha, the Kasivisvesvara and the Galaganatha i in Patad- 

kal are the most important of such examples to be found in the 

Badami Chalukyan territory. The Huchchimalligudi, the Huch- 

chappayyagudi, and the Mallikarjuna are the earliest of this 

group. These are generally tri rathas with front mandapas. The 

outer wall is plain or decorated and often provided with a pillared 

porch. The former ones are of sandhara type, while the latter one 

is of the nirandhara type, though they are similar in general 

outward form to the first. 



The Kadasiddhesvara, and the Jambulinga at Pattadkal are the 

simplest ones. They have a sanctum with a tri ratha sikhara and а 

mandapa in front. The Kasivisvesvara is pancha ratha, while the 

Galaganatha is sandhara with three sides of the sanctum outer wall 





194 . TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





conspicuously: projected as flat-roofed porches, and with a tri ratha 

sikhara, The Papanatha has a low and linear plan with a stunted 

sikhara over the main edifice which appears to be too small in 

proportion to the whole length made up of the disproportionately 

large antarala in front of the sanctum, with a mandapa and a 

portico as its front. The most interesting feature is the hara of 

salas with karnakutas at the front corners and a few panjaras in 

between that extend continuously over the roof of the axial manda- 

pas, а southern feature appropriate only to the vimana type of 

temples. The Sangamesvara in the Mahakutesvara group is of the 

tri ratha lay-out with a pillared mandapa in front. The presence of 

achute in the form of a groove ending as an oblong opening on 

top of the adhishthana on its northern side as a water outlet from 

the floor of the sanctum is an interesting feature. 



In the Eastern Chalukyan area comprising the district of 

Kurnool, Mahboobnagar and Guntur, we have such rekha- 

prasada-type temples built from the seventh-eighth centuries. In 

the Navabrahma complex of nine temples in Alampur, ail except 

the Tarakabrahma, which is of the southern vimana type, are of 

this variety. They mostly date earlier than A.D. 713 when, as 

stated in an inscription, the prakara enclosing the whole group 

was built by Isanacharya. They are mostly nirandhara while a few 

are sandhara. Each unit consists of а sanctum with a well-propor- 

tioned tri ratha sikhara, an antarala and pillared mandapa with a 

two-tiered flat roof. The whole axial series has a single entrance 

in front and a continuous wall surrounding it, forming also the 

outer wall of the cell in the sandhara type. The exterior wallfaces ' 

are richly carved with niches, surmounted by udgama motifs con- 

taining fine sculptures and lattice windows. The carvings are fine, 

and reminiscent of the central Indian and Rajasthani styles. The 

Balabrahma is the most advanced and elaborate specimen of the 

group. 



The Mahanandi group of temple units, also enclosed by a 

common prakara, consists, among other structures, of six miniature 

shrines of varying types in one group and four smaller shrines in 





4 





OTHER TEMPLE TYPES 195 





another behind the principal Mahanandisvara, which is a sandhara- 

rekha-prasada with a tri ratha type sikhara, datable to A.D. 750. The 

Bhimalingesvara and Ramalingesvara of the complex at Satyavolu 

(Kurnool district) that form the principal units of the group are 

both nirandhara with a tri ratha sikhara, over а square body. They, 

in addition to having the adhishthana akin to that of the southern 

vimana type, show also a vyala vari or vyala mala, a frieze of vyalas 

in the entablature, an invariable component of the prastara of the 

southern vimana temples, and absent in all the other rekha- 

prasadas. The larger Ramalingesvara has a sanctum, antarala and 

axial mandapas in front. The shrine wall is plain but for a deva- 

koshtha niche on each side. Among the diminutive shrines are to 

be found specimens with square, rectangular and apsidal plans. 

The square one is similar in form to the Huchchimalligudi with a 

stepped-up series of six horizontal kapota-like tiers crowned by ' an 

amalasara, an example of the Kadamba-Chalukya model. 



The Panchalingesvara, also near Kurnool, though much reno- 

vated, also belongs to this class. It is sandhara in plan and its 

present superstructure is a modern renovation in the Kadamba- 

Chalukya style. It has a pillared mandapa in front with a central 

raised clerestory roof and lateral wings with slopy roofs. It con- 

tains an inscription of Vijayaditya's time, about A.D. 750. Another 

well-preserved temple of this type is to be found in Bandi Tandra- 

padu nearby with a nirandhara body, having carvings of Ganesa, 

Durga and Kartikeya on the relieved bhadra niches on its sides. 

The sukanasika in front of the sikhara is prominent. 





The Somesvara at Chebrolu, and the Panchalingesvara at 

Panchalingula also belong to this category. The miniature shrines 

found in the Yelesvaram excavations are akin to the diminutive 

experiments found in the Satyavolu and Mahanandi complexes. 



This type of rekha-prasadas soon fell out of vogue in these areas; 

it could not extend any further south into the Tamil territory.. 





196 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 

THE KERALA TEMPLE TYPES 





The Kerala temples form a class by themselves because of the 

material used in their construction that includes timber to a large 

extent, as was the case everywhere in south India before the 

advent of the stone vimanas. Though in a few places the vimana 

temples of the medieval and late medieval periods and styles (as 

in Tamil Nadu) are to be found, the vast majority have their bascs 

and walls built of granite and laterite, respectively, with the roof 

of wooden planks, or tiles, or sheet metal over timber frames, and 

their forms are adapted to suit the high rainfall of the region. 

While the adhishthana of the vimana or Srikoyil is of moulded 

stone with all parts resembling those of the adhishthana of the 

southern temples, the walls are usually of laterite blocks which are 

abundant in the area, and can be cut and shaped easily when 

freshly quarried. Because of their rough and pitted surface, the 

walls are heavily plastered and the few decorations are picked out 

in stucco. The walls form a good ground for mural paintings 

which take the place of relief sculptures. The Kerala temples are 

thus noted for their rich colour paintings executed on the lime- 

plastered walls in fresco technique. The roof timbers rest directly 

on the wall plate on top of the walls, and converge in gable form 

to meet at the top. The roofing material covering the timber frame- 

work is clinker-built. It is made up of laminated wooden planks 

overlapping one another and covered over by clinkertiles or tiles 

highly heated in kilns with a vitreous or glassy smooth surface 

that makes them waterproof. It is this fish-scale-like overlapping 

pattern of tiles that is found reproduced in the covering plaster of 

the brick-and-mortar sikharas of the southern vimanas. The roof 

may alternatively be of metal sheet—copper or brass, which is 

again found imitated even in the earliest monolithic models at 

Mababalipuram, the Draupadi Ratha, for instance. Like the 

Draupadi Ratha, the Kerala temples in their simplest form have 

only the four essential parts instead of six of the simple vimana, 

namely, the adhishthana or base, the bhitti or wall, the sikhara or 





OTHER TEMPLE TYPES 197 





roof, and the stupi or finial. The prastara and griya below the ulti- 

mate roof are eliminated. The entablature and hara may be seen 

in storeyed forms only. The usual plan for the Srikoyil or vimana 

is the square or the circle and the apsidal. The rectangle is more 

common for the mandapas and gopuras which are called padi-p- 

pura. The rafters of the roof project beyond the wall, forming 

well-formed  eaves-like kapotas. These are often additionally 

supported by a carved wooden frame-work with carved wooden 

brackets sprung from the walls, caryatid-like. In larger vimanas the 

body is sandhara or double-walled with a circumambulatory, or 

idai nali, round the shrine-chamber, the inner wall rising up to 

form a second tala as it were, and carrying the conical or pyra- 

midal gable roof. The circumambulatory has a roof at a lesser 

level which slopes down from the middle height of tne inner wall 

and projects eaves-like over the top of the outer wall. The conical 



or slopy main roof has dormer, or nasika, projections, which are 

called kilivasal locally, with finely-carved wooden forana-frames 

fronting them. Their entire forms, or at least their fronts—mukha- 



patti, retain the arched or horse-shoe shape in most cases, while ja 



some they are simply triangular. The local name kilivasal (parrot 



entrance) is suggestive of the name sukanasika. It is not also un- 

usual for the outer wall to be circular, with the inner one round 

the sanctum square, or vice-versa. Normally, there is only one 

entrance on the east or west of the Srikoyil. On the remaining three 

sides there are niches or false doors. In some cases, the entrances 

are found on both east and west, the space inside the shrine- 

chamber being divided into an eastern and a western half by a 

transverse wall, each half containing a different deity. In front of 

the entrance is a flight of stone steps flanked by stone side-slabs or 

balustrades, which contain rich relief sculptures, the banister Or 

coping being shaped in the form of an elephant trunk issuing from 

a vyala mouth, or similar interesting patterns. The pranala, or 

water-outlet, projected from the northern side, is of a characteristic 

shape—thick, long, cylindrical and tube-like, with a narrow bore 

made through it, simulating a straight elephant's trunk emerging 





198 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





out of a vyala mouth. Externally, it is often ribbed and divided 

into ringed nodes at intervals and supported below by a bhuta or 

gana. The Srikoyil has a detached small front mandapa, often 

square with а slopy roof, called the namaskara-mandapa. External- 

ly, the quadrangular open court is surrounded by a prakara with 

a cloister, or malika, locally called nalambalam or chuttambalam. 

There may be more quadrangular enclosures, the outermost with 

the main gopura entrance or padi-p-pura, in front, occasionally 

with additional ones on the rear and on the sides. Besides the inner 

prakara which is simpler, larger temple complexes like the Vadak- 

kunnatha temple in Trichur have an outer prakara with storeyed 

gopura entrances on all the four sides, and detached halls or man- 

dapas in the court, like the rangasala or kuttambalam, for operas, 

dances and similar performances, for which Kerala is noted, 

especially dance-dramas and pantomime shows, like Kathakah, 

Ottantullal, etc. In the Vadakkunnatha temple, the subsidiary 





shrine for Sasta, at the north-east corner of the outer court is 





apsidal with a timber-and-metal sheet roof. 



Most of the Kerala temples now existing are not very old, the 

oldest dating from medieval or post-mediaval times. The oldest 

ones, because of the perishable fabric of construction, have been 

lost, but for their stone adhishthanas and sculptures of gods, dvara- 

palas, etc. These give us an idea of the continuity from at least the 

tenth century A.D.,-if not earlier. 



Such temples with prominent slopy or pent roofs, or ridged-roofs 

on gables, are to be found extensively distributed over the entire 

monsoon-swept littoral, from Kanyakumari in the south to south 

Kanara and Goa on the north. Their Srikoyil or vimana plans 

include the circular, which is more frequent, the elliptical, the 

square, the oblong and the apsidal, and they rise often in more 

than one storey. When storeyed, the lower storeys have their slopy 

or pent roofs resting on rafters with their overhanging eaves on 

the outer walls further supported by brackets sprung from the 

outer wall and sloping down from 'beams on hooks fixed at a 

higher lever on the inner wall. The top storey over the innermost 





OTHER TEMPLE TYPES 199 





wall is covered over by a conical or four-sided kula roof with a 

single finial in the case of circular, octagonal, and sguare structures, 

or by a ridged sala or sabha type on gable walls, with a row of 

stupis in the case of the oblong and apsidal structures. The adhish- 

thana is invariably of granitic stone, while the walls and superstruc- 

ture may be of granite, laterite or brick and timber. The roof is 

made of planks, metal shect or tiles, or even thatch in extremely 

humble cases. Most of these temples, some with original found- 

ations dating from the tenth-eleventh centuries, have been consider- 

ably renovated and reconstructed in their upper parts in recent 

centuries and as a result do not reveal much that can be attributed 

to or interpreted as evolutionary trends. 



Usually what goes unnoticed is the internal make-up and struc- 

tural contents of the Srikoyil, since, by ritual, tradition and con- 

vention, the interior of the Kerala temple is totally inaccessible to 

any except the ordinated priesthood. What one perceives of the 

Srikoyil is in fact an external shell, as it were, of a core vimana or 

garbhakudi inside. The internal core containing the garbha or 

sanctum is in essentials a vimana form as found elsewhere in the 

south, often with a full complement of its anges in the tiered 

superstructure over the cella, including the crest or sikara, or 

more commonly ending up with its griva; in either case the super- 



_ structure is raised up over the cella by the system of internal cor- 

belling or kadalika karana. The pedestal of the principal deity on 

the sanctum floor is called the pithika, and the space all round it 

inside the cella, the vithika, the wall of the cella itself being called 

the antara mandala. The circuit outside the antara mandala, in which 

are erected the rings of pillars going to support the external roof- 

ing, is the antara hara, which is circumscribed by the antara bhitti 

or inner wall of the Srikoyil between which and the bahya bhitti or 

outermost wall, in a sandhara structure, runs the ambulatory 

passage called the idai nali. The plan of this nuclear unit often 

dces not correspond with the ground plan of the Srikoyil and its 

plinth and it is usual to find that the cella is square, inside what is 

externally a circular or apsidal structure or vice versa. The 





200 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





ultimate esternal conical (domical) or ridged roof either covers the 

inner sikhara over the nuclear inner structure like an umbrella 

with its sfupi or it is made to rest on the top of the griva itself 

forming sikhara with stupi as common to both. 



The eaves (avalambana) of this sikhara is extended and rendered 

slopy on all sides, (with dormer projections or nasikas projected 

out of the faces) in order to overhang and shelter the tala face 

below of the external superstructure even as the chadyas or pro- 

jected, slopy eaves from the various levels below do їп respect of 

the parts below them, the lowest among tbem, in the case of a 

multi-storeyed structure or the avalambana of the single main roof 

or sikhara in the case of the ekatala or single-storeyed structure 

coming to overshadow the main outer wall that rises over the 

adhishthaza of the structure. 



While, essentially, the nuclear fane or the sanctum sanctorum 

is of the usual vimana type as found developed in the mainland 

part east of the Western Ghats, the outer Srikoyil structure is au 

adaptation to form a protective armour, so to say, shielding the 

inner core from the excessive and continuous monsoon precipit- 

ation of the western littoral, much like an umbrella—single- or, 

multiple-tiered—or a shell. The pian of the Srikoyil, as mentioned 

earlier, is generally square, or may be oblong or elliptical when 

intended to house reclining - deities, or circular, or apsidal, the 

apse arms having often a proportionately greater width to appro- 

ximate in shape a semi-circle, as suggested by the descriptive name 



' chapa (bow). The roofing or sikhara is kutagara or domical, the 

sides converging to an apex with a single stupi or salakara with 

gable ends, extended, - with а longitudinal ridge on top carrying a 

row of stupis, in either case, as appropriate to the plan and shape 

of the structure “below. In addition to the simple, single-storeyed 

Srikoyil, two- and three-storeyed types are also common. But 

judging from the local texts and from the extant models of Sri- 

Koyils a talachchanda of more than three storeys does not ѕест to 

be contemplated or attempted. The nirandhara (sin gle-walled) 

ekatala structure is devoid of a sukanasa, while the sandhara 





OTHER TEMPLE TYPES 201 





(double-walled with an annular passage in between) ekatala struc- 

ture of any plan has of necessity a sukanasa, as dictated by its 

very sandhara nature, as also the double or triple-storeyed ones. 

The multi-storeyed types exhibit a kara scheme of aedicules at top 

of each tier or fala, (equated with the term griva in Kerala texts) 

of successively diminishing height in their arrangement one over 

the other. The true sandhara nature may be inferred, even from 

outside, by the fact that superposed eaves of the multi-storeyed 

structure (that are, of course, separated from one another, 

in the vertical plane, by the intervening fala or griva) comes 

over the hara elements of the tala-prastara below, as ап overhang- 

ing chadya. This, because the respective chadyas, emerge from what 

would otherwise be the kapota tier of the tala-prastara in a 

soüthern vimana prototype. In the nirandhara pattern with a thick 

wall, the hara aedicules would appear to be placed over the line of 

emergence of the chadyas or eaves, since it is a case of the chadyas 

being sprung at convenient levels and strutted up in position by 

the carved brackets sprung from the wall itself. Internally the 

support for the sikhara roof and the successive chadya caves below 

is afforded by the top of the garbhakudya in combination with the 

' system of walls and concentric rings of pillars of graded heights 

on which the skeletal framework of beams, sloping rafters, cross- 

pieces that are further secured by the planking over is constructed. 

The actual water-proof covering is laid over the planking in the 

form of clinkertiles, or metal sheeting (copper or brass). This 

accords with the regional climatic requirements, and the steep slant 

of the sikhara sides and the chadya eaves not only drain quickly 

the heavy rain-water and throw it away, but also protect painted 

stucco or wooden sculpture work wrought over the faces of the 

fala walls and the main wall below. Thus a diligent comparative 

study would indicate more a taxonomic homology with the parts of 

the southern vimana type with such modifications as called for by 

the local climatic environment, especially in respect of the sikhara 

and chadya forms, than a seeming analogy with the Orissan pida- 

deuls or the phansanakara styles of western India, or even the _

canopied temples of the sub-Himalayan tract. 



The intervening parts of the idai nali, immediately in front of 

the door-opening of the garbhakudya and lying between it and the 

outer principal door-opening of the Srikoyil fronton constitutes, 

functionally, the ardha-mandapa part in the scheme and thus comes 

to have a sukanasa superstructure over it as a frontal projection 

of the main: Srikoyil superstructure. This, as in the Chalukyan 

temples and its cohorts, will be in addition to the maha nasikas on 

top of the Srikoyil. _ 



In front of the outer door-opening isthe flight of steps. It may 

be a single flight of steps or sopana marga, laid in front of the 

door providing direct ascent. Or, often, there isa landing laid in 

front of the doorway with lateral flights of steps, one on either 

side. While the frontal sopana marga is flanked on either side with 

surulyal( balustrades, with sculptured outer faces, the làteral flights 

have each of them, a similar balustrade flanking the front edges of 

the steps with carvings. The front of the central block with the 

landing on top of it likewise contains sculptures. These balustrade 

sculptures along with the dyarapala figures form the only signi- 

ficant stone sculptures in the Srikoyil make-up. 



Perhaps one of the largest complexes in this series of temples is 

the Vadakkunnatha, or Ten-Kailasam, or Sri Mulanatha temple, 

perched picturesquely on a low hilly promontory in the centre of 

Trichur town, which itself is almost at the centre of Kerala terri- 

tory. From its inscriptions the temple is known to have been in 

existence from the twelfth century, though its foundations could 

have been “much older. The nuclear structures inside the nal- 

ambalam or inner malika prakara are the three independent 

shrines standing almost in a line north-south, all of them facing 

west. The circular Srikoyil of Vadakkunnatha,.the most northerly 

of the row, has its sanctum cella divided by a transverse. diagonal 

wall. The western half enshrining Siva has its own door-opening 

and flight of steps in front with a detached namaskara-mandapa in 

front. The eastern half is dedicated to Devi-Parvati with a door 

opening on the east. The northern and southern faces have false

doors, or ghanadyaras. Over the moulded stone adhishthana, the 

outer wall of the sandhara structure and its prastara show the 

characteristic reliefs of pilasters and miniature shrines of the kuta, 

sala, and panjara models, as in the Tamil Nadu temples, The 

slopy conical roof of metal sheet covers these by its overhanging 

eaves supported by brackets sprung from the wall at intervals. The 

inner wall rising up further actually carries this immense conical 

roof, or sikhara, with a single metal stupi on top. The most 

southerly of the group is the two-storeyed shrine of Rama, square 

on plan, with its adhishthana, walls, and prastara relieved five 

times on each of its four faces. The central reliefs on the side and 

rear faces, corresponding to the door-opening on the west, have 

false doors inset between the pilasters carrying the sala motif on 

top. The corner bays have the karnakutas at the corners and the 

intervening ones the panjaras. The narrow recesses have lesser 

shrine motifs on paired pilasters. These kuta, sala, panjara reliefs 

are overshadowed by the overhanging eaves of the pent roof 

sloping down from hooks and beams, set higher up on the face of 

the inner wall, and resting on the wall-plate of the outer wall, the 

overhanging eaves further supported by intricately carved carya- 

tid-like wooden brackets sprung from the top_region of the outer 

wall again. The inner wall rises up to a further level, carrying the 

four-sided domical ultimate roof, or sikhara, also of metal sheet, 

with a stupi on top. The sikhara roof has four nasikas, or dormers 

at the middle of its four sides. In between the Rama and Siva 

shrines, there is a third shrine dedicated to Sankaranarayana, or 

Harihara, circular in plan and two-storeyed in its rise. Its adhish- 

thana and wall are likewise relieved, the larger bays in the middle 

of the north, east and south sides being sala patterns, with a false 

door inside a stambha torana front with a makara arch on top. The 

other bays correspond to the kuta or panjara patterns—all two- 

storeyed models—while the recesses have again such two-storeyed 

models of lesser size with sala sikhara motifs on tops of shorter 

and more closely set pairs of pilasters. On the southern side of the 

Vadakkunnatha shrine, on the floor of the open court, is the 





204 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





Saptamatrika group, the component deities being represented by a 

row of padma pithas alone, a characteristic of Kerala temples. All 

the three central shrines have mukha-mandapams on the west. 

There is also a smaller shrine for Ganapati, interposed between 

the Siva and Harihara temples. The walls of the shrines are richly 

painted and the timberwork and brackets ornately carved. The 

nalambalam or pillared corridor, surrounding the nuclear group, 

has on its outside a larger wider open court, with a paved circum- 

ambulatory passage immediately to its outside. The lesser shrines 

for subsidiary deities like Krishna, Nandi, Parasurama, and Sasta 

are also located in the outer court. The shrine of Sasta on the 

south-west is an elegant, smail, east-facing ekatala, apsidal struc- 

ture, gaja-prishthakara, appropriate to Sasta, whose vehicle is the 

elephant. It is perhaps the smallest apsidal structure in the Kerala 

mode of construction. In the north-west corner of the outer court 

is the large kuttambalam or opera-hall, rectangular in shape, and 

built in typical Kerala style. Inside is a central pavilion with ex- 

quisitely lathe-turned pillars which, in addition to the caryed 

pillars of the hall and the woodwork of the ceiling, add to the 

splendour of the structure. The whole complex is surrounded by 2 

massive stone prakara, with four-storeyed gateways on the four 

cardinal sides with slopy gable roofs, standing as good examples of 

gopura construction in the Kerala style. е 

Another large and important temple complex іп the south of 

Kerala is the Padmanabhasvami, or Anantasayanam temple in 

Trivandrum, which was wholly reconstructed in the last two cen- 

turies. The stone-buill central shrine is appropriately oblong on 

plan to enshrine the reclining form of Anantasayin Vishnu. It is 

two-storeyed with pent and gable roof patterns for its storeys. The 

walls are painted and tliere are subsidiary shrines for deities like 

Krishna, Kshetrapala, Narasimha, Sasta, Garuda, etc. The open- 

pillared mandapa round the complex, with .stone pillars, and the 

eastern gopura of stone body and brickwork superstructure are in 

the style of Tamil Nadu temples, while a subsidiary entrance to the 

north of the gopura is in the traditional Kerala pattern with a gable

roof and kilivasal nasikas, 



The Srikoyil of the celebrated Guruvayur temple, dedicated to 

Krishna, is square and two-storeyed with metal sheet gable roofs, 

as in the above two cases. It has the chuttambalam and prakara 

encircling it. The other noteworthy temples, single-or more-storeyed 

and built of laterite, brick and wood, and roofed by metal sheet or 

tiles, are the Siva temples at Tiruvanchikalam, Tali (near Kozhi- 

kode), Taliparamba, Tiruprangode, Perumanam, Trikkandiyur, 

Trittala and Sukapuram, the Rama temples at Trichchambaram 

and Tirunavay, and the Bhagavati temple at Kodungallur. The 

Tiruvanchikalam shrine is square on plan and ashlar-built, double- 

walled and two-storeyed, the lower slopy roof resting over the 

outer wall, and the upper one over the raised inner wall, both of 

metal sheeting. The upper roof in its overhanging eaves, further 

supported by wooden brackets profusely carved, has four kiliyasal 

nasikas projected from the sloping sides. The walls contain some 

good sculpture and carving. The top stupi is of gold-plated copper. 



The Taliparamba temple is almost similar, quadrangular on 

plan and double-walled, with the roof in two storeys. The lower 

pent roof slopes down on the top of the shorter outer wall and the 

upper pyramidal or kuta roof caps the top of the inner walls. In 

front there is the namaskara-mandapa with a sloped roof and two , 

projecting gables at either end. The remnants of a large gopuram 

demolished during Tipu Sultan's invasions are still extant. 



The Tali temple near Kozhikode is again another structure of 

the same kind, square, double-walled, and two-storeyed, the roofs 

made cf modern tiles. The adhishthana and the walls show the usual 

five reliefs on bcth the side and rear faces, the central widest with 

a sala over the prastara, and a false door inset into a torana, placed 

between the wall pilasters below; the extreme bays relate to the 

karnakutas, while the intermediate ones, the smallest, to the panja- 

ras of the prastara. The recesses show narrow windows between 

close-set pairs ‘of pilasters carrying panjara tops reaching to the 

level of the kapota of the prastara. Its stone sculptures are of a 

fine quality as also the wood-carving on the ceiling of the 





- 206 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





namaskara-mandapa. 



The Rama temple of Tiruvangad in north Kerala is unigue in 

having a rectangular Srikoyil with a linear orientation, that is, with 

the entrance on one of the shorter sides of the oblong structure. It 

is two-storeyed. The front elevation on the face with the main door- 

way is almost vertical, while the two longer sides and the shorter 

rear side have the slopy pent roof at the lower level, and the ridged 

gable roof at the higher level with three stupis in a linear row on the 

ridge along the longitudinal axis. The roofs are of copper sheeting. 

In front there is a mukha-mandapa, also oblong, but with its long 

axis transverse to that of the Srikoyil and provided with stupis over 

its transversely-oriented ridge. All round there is а nalambalam of 

lesser height. : T 



The.Krishna temple at Trichchambaram, noted for its excellent 



wood-carvings illustrating scenes from the Bhagavata, has a Srikoyil 

square on plan and sandhara in its make-up, with the roof of both 

the storeys covered with copper plate. The lower pent roof is ex- 

tended forward, as the sukanasa, with a front triangular gable face 

over the idai nali or linear antarala-mandapa, in front of which is an 

independent namaskara-mandapa. The upper four-sided pyramidal 

roof has projected kilivasal nasikas on its. four sides, with arched 

or horse-shoe-shaped front; there is a single stupi on top. The 

Tirunavay, Vishnu temple also belongs to the' same category. 

The Perumanam Siva temple dedicated to Erattayappan is a 

three-storeyed version of the kind with a frontal antarala projec- 

tion of two storeys in front, and the top pyramidal roof unique 

in being octagonal. It is raised over an eight-sided neck with 

kilivasal nastkas projected from each of. the eight octant faces; 

The lower roofs are made of tiles and the octagonal sikhara of 

, metal sheet. 



The twin temples of Rama and Lakshmana standing side by side, 

in Tiruvilvamalai, the former (facing east and the latter, west, are 

interesting. Both are of ћезате plan and rise, square, sandhara, 

and with a projected gable roof from the lower tier over a linear 

front antarala-mandapa. The roofs ate made of metal sheeting and 





\ 





OTHER TEMPLE TYPES 207 





the four-sided pyramidal sikharas have four kilivasal nasikas and 

single metal gold-gilt stupis on top. The walls are decorated with 

sculptures, the Dasavatara sculptures on the Lakshmana temple 

being particularly noteworthy. The Rama temple has undergone 

renovation recently. 



The Rama temple at Tiruprayar has a circular ekatala Srikoyil 

and is noted for its ancient wood-carvings. The namaskara-mandapa 

has profuse wood-carvings, while the wall ofthe shrine has in- 

teresting mural paintings. The Srikoyil at Vaikom is similar, circular 

and ekatala, with an immense conical copper-sheet roofing, and a 

single stupi. The Srikoyil of Thrikotithanám, another ancient struc- 

ture, is likewise of circular plan but two-storyed, as also is the Sri- 

koyil of Payyanur, which has a boldly moulded stone adhishthana 

and finely carved caryatid brackets supporting the eaves of the lower 

pent roof. The Siva temple at Ettumanur, noted for its paintings, 

especially of Nataraja, has a simple ekatala Srikoyil, which is also 

circular on plan. 



While-the small Sasta shrine in the outer precincts of the Vadak- 

kunnathan temple at Trichur stands for a simple ekatala apsidal, 

or gaja-prishtha vimana, the Siva temple at Tiruvannur exemplifies 

a two-storeyed and larger version of the type. The pent roof cover- 

ing the storey below and the apsidal ridged roof above, with a gable 

front, has a row of. three stupis on top. The Subrahmanya temple 

at Payyanur is another example of a two-storeyed structure of the 



gaja-pishtha class with a square namaskara-mandapa and a trans- 





versely oblong mukha-mandapam in ftont, all metal sheet-roofed, 

and having a tiled nalambalam of a lesser height running all round. 





The decayed temple at Tripparangode, and-the one at Tiruvannur 

near Kozhikode, аге:уеї other examples of the same class. The com- 

paratively modern Ananthavinayakar temple at Madhur in north 

Malabar, also 'gaja-prishtha,-has its roof in three tiers, the two lowest 

ones with pent roof and tiled; the upper lean-to-roof and the ulti- 



.mate apsidal roof are of copper sheeting. 



. "The Bhagavati or Durga temple at Kodungallur of ancient fame 

is now a total modern renovation, of course in the indigenous style. 





208 TEMPLES OF SOUTH INDIA 





The main Srikoyil is two-storeyed with a subsidiary Siva shrine td 

its left. 



Among the temples with southern style vimanas, akin to those 

of the adjoining districts of Tamil Nadu, and more or less con- 

centrated in the south Travancore and Kanyakumari regions, may 

be mentioned the Guhanathasvami temple of stone of Kanya- 

kumari of the middle Chola period, with the superstructure lost; the 

Parthivasekharapuram temple, four-storeyed with the superstruc- 

ture in brick-and-mortar over the stone body of the late Chola or 

Pandya period; and the Banatirtha temple with tritala vimana of 

the late Vijayanagar period, with the vimanas all square on plan. 

The Parasurama shrine in the Tiruvallam temple complex and the 

Valiya Udaiyadichapuram shrine with a stone body and brickwork 

superstructure are examples of dvitala and tritala vimanas of vritta 

or circular plan of the sixteenth century and later. The largest 

temple complex of this kind is the one at Suchindram, with struc- 

tures inside dating from the ninth-tenth centuries A.D., a chitra- 

sabha built in 1410, a mandapa, called the Chempakaraman 

Mandapam, built in 1471, and the gopura built in about 1545. 

` The Kanara temples, as Cousens calls them, form an interesting 

group, though small in number, characterised by their plain sloping 

roofs of stone slabs with a peculiar arrangement for closing in the 

sides. This -is adapted to the excessive rainfall of the place that 

makes for the deep gradient of the roof, and its extension much 

downwards to cut off the beating rain. The sides of the halls inside 

are closed by screens and often they are storeyed. Inside they often 

contain lathe-turned pillars, but in general the columns are short, 

squat and clumsy, rather degenerate Chalukyan forms. Their affili- 

ations have been mentioned earlier and besides the Ketapi Narayana 

temple, we have examples of such temples in Bhatkal itself, also in 

Mudabidri and its neighbourhood.

"The temple is the' most significant monument of- Indian 

architecture, which sums up and represents the sübtle values of

followed the firm establishment of image worship and the 

accompanying development of the ritual, which took time to 



. crystallise. The different evolution of the architectural form 

between North, South and other parts of India was an even later

the chronologically uninterrupted chain of extent South Indian 

temples, explaining the niceties of their architecture, the many 

subtle variations in style, and their evolution over the years.
