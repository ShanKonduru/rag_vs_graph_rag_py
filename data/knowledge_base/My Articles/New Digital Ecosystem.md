New Digital Ecosystem

Being part of an IT service industry for the past 26+ years predominantly focusing on Quality Assurance (QA), Test Automation, and DevOps and other service offerings, we understood that if we continue to offer only these service offerings we might perish and we may become obsolete, and will not be able to scale, achieve speed and achieve greater market penetration.  So we felt the need to pivot our service offerings into Digital space. To expedite the pivoting process, we grew the organization via inorganic manner by acquiring a Digital Service Offering Company. Which gave us an opportunity to compete in the digital economy. 

The following are key levers we relied upon In order to build the new digital ecosystem, 

Offer Bundled Solutions: We Considered packaging your core services with complementary offerings (or adjacent offerings).

Partner Program: Formalize the ecosystem strategy with a well-defined partner program, licensing agreements. 

Focus on Industry Verticals: Tailored our ecosystem partnerships to address the unique needs of specific industry verticals (e.g., FinTech, Healthcare, E-commerce). 

Education and Training: Equipped our teams with the skills and knowledge to effectively leverage the technologies and platforms within your ecosystem. 

Adopt to Open-Source Communities: Engaging with relevant open-source projects can foster collaboration, expose you to new technologies, and attract potential partners and talent.

Continuously Evolve and Adapt: The digital landscape is constantly changing. Regularly evaluate our ecosystem partnerships and be open to adding new partners and adapting our offerings to meet evolving market demands.

Which Digital Giants Should Be Part of Your Ecosystem and Why?

Cloud Platform Providers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform - GCP): 

Why: These platforms form the foundation for many digital initiatives. Integrating your QA, Test Automation, and DevOps services with their cloud infrastructure, deployment tools, and monitoring services is crucial for ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of cloud-native applications. They offer vast reach and a large customer base.

DevOps Toolchain Providers (e.g., Atlassian (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket), GitLab, GitHub, Jenkins): 

Why: These tools are central to the software development lifecycle. Integrating your services with these platforms allows for seamless incorporation of quality assurance and automated testing into the development and deployment pipelines. This enables faster feedback loops and improved software quality.

Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and Observability Platforms (e.g., Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace): 

Why: Integrating your QA and testing capabilities with APM and observability tools provides real-time insights into application performance and user experience. This allows for proactive identification and resolution of issues, ensuring the quality and stability of deployed applications.

Which Tech Entrepreneurs Should Be Part of Your New Ecosystem and Why?

Startups with Innovative Testing Technologies (e.g., AI-powered testing, visual regression testing, performance engineering): 

Why: Collaborating with agile and innovative startups can bring cutting-edge technologies and approaches to your service offerings, differentiating you from competitors and providing unique value to your clients.

Platforms Focused on Low-Code/No-Code Testing and Development: 

Why: As low-code/no-code platforms gain traction, integrating your QA and testing expertise with these platforms can help ensure the quality and reliability of applications built with these tools. This opens new market segments.
