Ravi Mehta's Competency Model for Product Managers, while originally designed for traditional software product development, offers a powerful lens through which to analyze and adapt to the evolving landscape of AI. The core principles remain highly relevant, even as the specific skills within each competency shift.

Here's how we can draw correlations with AI Agents, Agentic AI, and AI in Quality Engineering (QE):

Correlation with Ravi Mehta's Competency Model:

1. Product Execution

Feature Specification:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: This shifts from defining static features to defining agentic behaviors, goals, and constraints. Instead of a fixed UI, you're specifying how an agent should perceive, reason, act, and learn within an environment. This involves defining the "intent" of the agent, the rules it should follow, and the conditions under which it should execute actions. Prompt engineering, defining system prompts, and structuring multi-step reasoning become key "spec" components.

AI in QE: For QE, feature specification extends to defining the quality attributes and acceptance criteria for AI models and systems. This includes specifying acceptable performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), fairness metrics, robustness against adversarial attacks, and ethical guidelines. It also involves specifying the data requirements for testing and the expected behavior under various conditions.

Product Delivery:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: This involves the iterative development, deployment, and monitoring of AI agents. It's less about traditional release cycles and more about continuous learning, adaptation, and safe deployment. MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) becomes crucial, encompassing version control for models and data, automated deployment pipelines, and real-time performance monitoring.

AI in QE: Delivery for AI in QE means implementing and integrating AI-powered testing tools and strategies. This includes building automated test frameworks for AI models, setting up continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for AI systems, and ensuring seamless integration of AI-driven quality checks into the overall development lifecycle.

Product Quality:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: Quality for agents extends beyond traditional bugs to ethical considerations, bias, explainability, safety, and reliability in real-world scenarios. It's about ensuring the agent performs as expected, avoids unintended consequences, and can be trusted by users. This involves rigorous testing for edge cases, adversarial examples, and unexpected interactions.

AI in QE: This involves developing and applying robust quality assurance methodologies specifically for AI systems. This means not only traditional software testing but also model validation, data quality checks, bias detection, fairness testing, robustness testing, and interpretability assessments. It's about ensuring the AI models are fit for purpose, reliable, and adhere to ethical guidelines.

2. Customer Insight

Fluency with Data:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: This is paramount. Understanding how agents learn from data, identifying data biases, and knowing how to effectively use data for training, evaluation, and fine-tuning are fundamental. It also includes analyzing agent performance data to identify areas for improvement and understanding user interaction patterns with the agent.

AI in QE: Data fluency is critical for analyzing model performance, identifying data drifts, and understanding the root causes of AI failures. QE professionals need to be adept at interpreting complex data visualizations, statistical analyses, and error patterns to inform testing strategies and improvements.

Voice of the Customer:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: This involves understanding user needs and expectations for agent behavior, how users interact with autonomous systems, and their trust levels. It's about gathering feedback on agent performance, understanding user frustration, and identifying areas where the agent falls short of user expectations or creates unintended negative experiences.

AI in QE: QE professionals need to understand how AI systems impact user experience and business outcomes. This means connecting technical quality metrics to user satisfaction, identifying how AI errors affect real users, and translating user feedback into actionable testing and improvement plans.

User Experience Design:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: UX design for agents shifts to designing interactions with autonomous systems, managing user expectations, and ensuring transparency and control. It's about designing how users provide input to agents, interpret agent outputs, and intervene when necessary. This also includes defining the "personality" and communication style of the agent.

AI in QE: While not directly designing the user experience, QE professionals influence it significantly by ensuring the AI system is usable, understandable, and provides reliable information to users. This can involve testing the clarity of AI-generated explanations, the ease of correcting AI errors, and the overall user-friendliness of AI-powered features.

3. Product Strategy

Business Outcome Ownership:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: This focuses on defining the tangible business value an AI agent will deliver. It's not just about building a smart system, but about how that system translates into increased revenue, reduced costs, improved efficiency, or enhanced customer satisfaction. This requires a deep understanding of the business problem the agent is solving.

AI in QE: For QE, this means demonstrating the ROI of AI in quality initiatives. It's about showing how AI-powered testing reduces bugs, accelerates release cycles, and ultimately contributes to higher quality products and better business outcomes.

Product Vision & Roadmapping:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: This involves setting a long-term vision for the capabilities and evolution of AI agents, considering ethical implications, scalability, and future integration with other systems. Roadmapping becomes more dynamic, adapting to new data, model advancements, and emergent behaviors.

AI in QE: This involves strategizing how AI will transform QE practices within the organization. It includes identifying areas where AI can have the most impact (e.g., test case generation, defect prediction), setting a roadmap for AI adoption in QE, and anticipating future challenges and opportunities.

Strategic Impact:

AI Agents/Agentic AI: This refers to the ability to integrate AI agents into the broader business strategy and drive transformational change. It's about understanding how agents can redefine market opportunities, create new business models, and disrupt industries. This often involves navigating complex regulatory and ethical landscapes.

AI in QE: This involves positioning QE as a strategic partner in AI development, ensuring that quality is embedded throughout the AI lifecycle and that AI systems are developed responsibly and ethically. It's about influencing organizational culture to prioritize AI quality and safety.

4. Influencing People (Leadership & Collaboration)

AI Agents/Agentic AI: This competency is amplified. Product managers for AI agents need to build and lead cross-functional teams with diverse skill sets (data scientists, ML engineers, ethicists, legal experts). They must effectively communicate the value and limitations of AI to stakeholders, manage expectations, and foster trust in autonomous systems.

AI in QE: QE leaders need to collaborate closely with AI development teams, data scientists, and business stakeholders to define quality standards, integrate testing processes, and advocate for ethical AI development. They must also educate and empower their own QE teams to adapt to AI-driven testing methodologies.

In summary, while the fundamental competencies in Ravi Mehta's model remain relevant, their manifestation and the specific skills required within each category are profoundly impacted by the nature of AI. The shift emphasizes a deeper understanding of data, ethical considerations, continuous learning, and cross-functional collaboration, all crucial for navigating the complexities of AI Agents, Agentic AI, and AI in Quality Engineering.
