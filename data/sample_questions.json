    "question": "How does machine learning work?",
    "expected_answer": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It works by using algorithms to identify patterns in data, build mathematical models based on training data, and make predictions or decisions on new data.",

    "question": "What are the main types of machine learning?",
    "expected_answer": "The main types of machine learning are: 1) Supervised learning, where models learn from labeled training data; 2) Unsupervised learning, where models find patterns in unlabeled data; and 3) Reinforcement learning, where models learn through interaction with an environment and feedback.",

    "question": "What is deep learning?",
    "expected_answer": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to model and understand complex patterns in data. It's particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.",

    "question": "What is natural language processing?",
    "expected_answer": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.",
