This means designing systems that can handle increased traffic, data, or user growth without compromising performance, reliability, or maintainability.\n\nOne approach to achieving scalability is through:\n\n1. **Microservices Architecture**: Breaking down the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, tested, and scaled independently.
